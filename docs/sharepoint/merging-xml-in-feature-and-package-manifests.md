# Merge XML in feature and package manifests
  Features and packages are defined by [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] manifest files. These packaged manifests are a combination of data generated from designers and custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] entered in the manifest template by users. At packaging time, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] merges the custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] statements with the designer-provided [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] to form the packaged [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] manifest file. Similar elements, with the exceptions noted later in Merge Exceptions, are merged to avoid [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] validation errors after you deploy the files to SharePoint, and to make the manifest files smaller and more efficient.

## Modify the manifests
 You cannot directly modify the packaged manifest files until you disable the feature or package designers. However, you can manually add custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] elements to the manifest template either through the feature and package designers or the [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] editor. For more information, see [How to: Customize a SharePoint Feature](../sharepoint/how-to-customize-a-sharepoint-feature.md) and [How to: Customize a SharePoint solution package](../sharepoint/how-to-customize-a-sharepoint-solution-package.md).

## Feature and package manifest merge process
 When combining custom elements together with designer-provided elements, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] uses the following process. [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] checks whether each element has a unique key value. If an element has no unique key value, it is appended to the packaged manifest file. Similarly, elements that have multiple keys cannot be merged. Therefore, they are appended to the manifest file.

 If an element has a unique key, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] compares the values of the designer and custom keys. If the values match, they merge into a single value. If the values differ, the designer key value is discarded and the custom key value is used. Collections are also merged. For example, if the designer-generated [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] and the custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] both contain an Assemblies collection, the packaged manifest contains only one Assemblies collection.

## Merge exceptions
 [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] merges most designer [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] elements together with similar custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] elements as long as they have a single, unique identifying attribute. However, some elements lack the unique identifier required for [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] merging. These elements are known as *merge exceptions*. In these cases, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../sharepoint/includes/vsprvs-md.md)] does not merge the custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] elements together with the designer-provided [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] elements, but instead appends them to the packaged manifest file.

 Following is a list of merge exceptions for feature and package [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] manifest files.

|Designer|XML Element|
|--------------|-----------------|
|Feature designer|ActivationDependency|
|Feature designer|UpgradeAction|
|Package designer|SafeControl|
|Package designer|CodeAccessSecurity|

## Feature manifest elements
 The following table is a list of all feature manifest elements that can be merged and their unique key that is used for matching.

|Element Name|Unique Key|
|------------------|----------------|
|Feature (all attributes)|*Attribute Name* (Each attribute name of the Feature element is a unique key.)|
|ElementFile|Location|
|ElementManifests/ElementManifest|Location|
|Properties/Property|Key|
|CustomUpgradeAction|Name|
|CustomUpgradeActionParameter|Name|

> [!NOTE]
> Because the only way to modify the CustomUpgradeAction element is in the custom [!INCLUDE[TLA2#tla_xml](../sharepoint/includes/tla2sharptla-xml-md.md)] editor, the effect of not merging is low.

## Package manifest elements
 The following table is a list of all package manifest elements that can be merged and their unique key that is used for matching.

|Element Name|Unique Key|
|------------------|----------------|
|Solution (all attributes)|*Attribute Name* (Each attribute name of the Solution element is a unique key.)|
|ApplicationResourceFiles/ApplicationResourceFile|Location|
|Assemblies/Assembly|Location|
|ClassResources/ClassResource|Location|
|DwpFiles/DwpFile|Location|
|FeatureManifests/FeatureManifest|Location|
|Resources/Resource|Location|
|RootFiles/RootFile|Location|
|SiteDefinitionManifests/SiteDefinitionManifest|Location|
|WebTempFile|Location|
|TemplateFiles/TemplateFile|Location|
|SolutionDependency|SolutionID|

## Manually add deployed files
 Some manifest elements, such as ApplicationResourceFile and DwpFiles, specify a location that includes a file name. However, adding a file name entry to the manifest template does not add the underlying file to the package. You must add the file to the project to include it in the package and set its Deployment Type property accordingly.
