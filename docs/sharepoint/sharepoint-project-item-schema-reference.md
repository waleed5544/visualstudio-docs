# SharePoint project item schema reference
  Visual Studio uses the SharePoint project item schema to validate the contents of *.spdata* files. An *.spdata* file specifies the contents and behavior of a SharePoint project item. For more information about the contents of SharePoint project items, see [Create item templates and project templates for SharePoint project items](../sharepoint/creating-item-templates-and-project-templates-for-sharepoint-project-items.md).

 The SharePoint project item schema is named ProjectItemModelSchema.xsd and is installed by default in %Program Files (x86)%\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Xml\Schemas.

 The root element is the [ProjectItem](../sharepoint/projectitem-element.md) element. The following table describes all of the elements defined by the schema.
