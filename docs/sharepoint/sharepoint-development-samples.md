# SharePoint development samples
  You can use Visual Studio to download and install samples of SharePoint applications from the [MSDN Code Gallery](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/).

 You can download each sample individually. You can also download a Sample Pack, which has related samples that share a technology or article. You'll receive a notification when source code changes are published for any sample that you download.
