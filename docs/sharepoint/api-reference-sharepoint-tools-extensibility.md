# API reference (SharePoint tools extensibility)
  This section contains API reference documentation for extending the SharePoint tools in Visual Studio.

## In this section
 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint>

 Contains types that you use to extend the SharePoint project system. For example, you can extend the built-in SharePoint projects and project items, or you can create your own project items.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Commands>

 Contains types that you can use to create custom *SharePoint commands*. A SharePoint command is a method that calls into the SharePoint server object model from a SharePoint tools extension.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Deployment>

 Contains types that you use to extend the deployment process for SharePoint projects.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Explorer>

 Contains types that you use to extend SharePoint nodes in **Server Explorer** or to define your own types of nodes.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Explorer.Extensions>

 Contains types that you can use to get information about built-in **Server Explorer** nodes that represent individual components on a SharePoint site, such as a node that represents a list, field, or content type.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Features>

 Contains types that you use to access the definition of a feature in a SharePoint project.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Packages>

 Contains types that you use to access the package definition in a SharePoint project.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Remote.Authentication>

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Remote.Commands>

 Contains types that you use to create SharePoint remote commands, which are used with apps for SharePoint that are deployed to remote SharePoint sites.

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Tasks>

 <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.SharePoint.Validation>

 Contains types that you use to customize the feature and package validation behavior for a SharePoint project.
