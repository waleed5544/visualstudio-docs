# Develop Office solutions
  After you design a project by using the Office developer tools in Visual Studio and set up the project files, you can begin to concentrate on implementing the code and custom user interface (UI).

## Office solutions programming model
 The Office object model exposes a variety of objects that you can program against. Whenever you program Office solutions by using managed code, you write code that uses types in the Office primary interop assemblies. In solutions you create by using the Office project templates in Visual Studio, you also write code directly against generated classes in your project. For more information, see [Write code in Office solutions](../vsto/writing-code-in-office-solutions.md).

## Program different types of Office solutions
 The type of solution that you are creating determines which features you can use in your project. For example, you can add Windows Forms controls and extended Office controls (named *host controls*) to document-level customizations by dragging items from the **Toolbox** in Visual Studio at design time. However, if you are developing a VSTO Add-in, you can only add these sorts of controls to documents at run time, by writing code.

 For more information about features that are specific to different types of solutions, see the following topics:

- [Program VSTO Add-ins](../vsto/programming-vsto-add-ins.md).

- [Program document-level customizations](../vsto/programming-document-level-customizations.md).

- [Office UI customization](../vsto/office-ui-customization.md).

  For background information to help you plan your Office solutions and procedures to help you create projects, see [Design and create Office solutions](../vsto/designing-and-creating-office-solutions.md).
