# Assemblies in the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime
  When you create an Office project, Visual Studio automatically adds references to the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)] assemblies that are used for the project type and the target .NET Framework of the project. There are different assemblies in the Office extensions for the .NET Framework 3.5, [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../sharepoint/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)], and [!INCLUDE[net_v45](includes/net-v45-md.md)]. For more information about the Office extensions, see [Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime overview](visual-studio-tools-for-office-runtime-overview.md).

## Assemblies in the Office extensions for the .NET Framework 4 and the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](includes/net-v45-md.md)]
 The following table lists the assemblies that are included in Office extensions for the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../sharepoint/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] and the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](includes/net-v45-md.md)]. For documentation about the namespaces and types in these assemblies, see [Managed reference &#40;Office development in Visual Studio&#41;](managed-reference-office-development-in-visual-studio.md).

|Assembly name|Description|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Common.dll|Provides the following types:<br /><br /> -   Types for creating Ribbon customizations and smart tags. **Note:**      Smart tags are deprecated in [!INCLUDE[Excel_14_short](includes/excel-14-short-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[Word_14_short](includes/word-14-short-md.md)].<br />-   Types for creating actions panes in document-level customizations and custom task panes in VSTO Add-Ins.|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.dll|Provides interfaces that represent host items and host controls for Excel projects, and supporting types. For more information, see [Automate Excel by using extended objects](automating-excel-by-using-extended-objects.md).|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Outlook.dll|Provides types that you can use to create custom form regions in Outlook VSTO Add-ins.|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.dll|Provides interfaces that represent host items and host controls for Word projects, and supporting types. For more information, see [Automate Word by using extended objects](automating-word-by-using-extended-objects.md).|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.v4.0.Framework.dll|Provides the following types:<br /><br /> -   Exceptions that can be thrown by the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime.<br />-   Attributes you can use when creating Outlook form regions.|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.dll|Provides types that are part of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime infrastructure, and are not intended to be used directly from your code.|
|Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.Runtime.dll|Provides the following types:<br /><br /> -   The <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.Runtime.CachedAttribute> attribute and <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.Runtime.ICachedType> interface, which you can use to cache data objects in a document-level customization. For more information, see [Cache data](caching-data.md).<br />-   The <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.Deployment.IAddInPostDeploymentAction> interface, which you can implement to run additional installation steps as the final step of the ClickOnce installer for an Office solution. For more information, see [Deploy an Office solution by using ClickOnce](deploying-an-office-solution-by-using-clickonce.md).<br />-   Exceptions that can be thrown by the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime.<br />-   Other types that are part of the Visual Studio Tools for Office runtime infrastructure, and are not intended to be used directly from your code.|
|Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.ServerDocument.dll|Provides the following types:<br /><br /> -   The <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Tools.Applications.ServerDocument> class, which you can use to attach customization assemblies to documents and to access the cached data in documents. For more information, see [Manage documents on a server by using the ServerDocument class](managing-documents-on-a-server-by-using-the-serverdocument-class.md).<br />-   Several classes that represent the hierarchy of cached data in a document-level customization. For more information, see [Access data in documents on the server](accessing-data-in-documents-on-the-server.md).|

 Projects that target the [!INCLUDE[net_v40_short](../sharepoint/includes/net-v40-short-md.md)] or the [!INCLUDE[net_v45](includes/net-v45-md.md)] also reference the following assemblies. These assemblies are not part of the [!INCLUDE[vsto_runtime](includes/vsto-runtime-md.md)] redistributable. Instead, they are dependent assemblies that must be deployed with your solution. By default, they are copied to the build output folder for your project (the **Copy Local** property for these assemblies are set to **True**). If you deploy your project by using ClickOnce, these assemblies are included in the generated package.

|Assembly name|Description|
|-------------------|-----------------|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Common.v4.0.Utilities.dll|Provides the base classes for the generated `ThisAddIn` class in VSTO Add-In projects and the generated Ribbon class in all projects.|

|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Outlook.v4.0.Utilities.dll|Provides base classes for the generated `ThisAddIn` and form region classes in Outlook projects.|
|Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.v4.0.Utilities.dll|Provides the following types:<br /><br /> -   Base classes for the generated `ThisDocument` class in document-level projects for Word.<br />-   Windows Forms controls that you can use on documents in Word projects.|
