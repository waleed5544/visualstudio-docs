# Data in Office solutions walkthroughs
  The following walkthroughs demonstrate how to work with data in document-level customizations and VSTO Add-ins for Microsoft Office Word and Microsoft Office Excel.

## Bind controls to data
- [Walkthrough: Simple data binding in a document-level project](../vsto/walkthrough-simple-data-binding-in-a-document-level-project.md)
 Demonstrates how to bind a single data field in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.NamedRange> in a document-level customization for Excel.

- [Walkthrough: Complex data binding in a document-level project](../vsto/walkthrough-complex-data-binding-in-a-document-level-project.md)
 Demonstrates how to bind a table in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> in a document-level customization for Excel.

- [Walkthrough: Simple data binding in VSTO Add-in project](../vsto/walkthrough-simple-data-binding-in-vsto-add-in-project.md)
 Demonstrates how to bind a single data field in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.RichTextContentControl> in a VSTO Add-in for Word.

- [Walkthrough: Complex data binding in VSTO Add-in project](../vsto/walkthrough-complex-data-binding-in-vsto-add-in-project.md)
 Demonstrates how to bind a table in a SQL Server database to a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> in a VSTO Add-in for Excel.

- [Walkthrough: Bind content controls to custom XML parts](../vsto/walkthrough-binding-content-controls-to-custom-xml-parts.md)
 Demonstrates how to bind content controls in a Word document to XML data that is stored in the document.

## Cache data in document-level solutions
- [Walkthrough: Create a master detail relation using a cached dataset](../vsto/walkthrough-creating-a-master-detail-relation-using-a-cached-dataset.md)
 Demonstrates how to create a master/detail relation on a worksheet, and cache the data so that the solution can be used offline.

- [Walkthrough: Insert data into a workbook on a server](../vsto/walkthrough-inserting-data-into-a-workbook-on-a-server.md)
 Demonstrates how to insert data into a dataset that is cached in a Microsoft Office Excel workbook without starting Excel.

- [Walkthrough: Retrieve cached data from a workbook on a server](../vsto/walkthrough-retrieving-cached-data-from-a-workbook-on-a-server.md)
