# XML schemas and data in document-level customizations

 Microsoft Office Excel and Microsoft Office Word provide the capability to map schemas to your documents. This feature can simplify importing and exporting XML data in and out of the document.

 Visual Studio exposes mapped schema elements in document-level customizations as controls in the programming model. For Excel, Visual Studio adds support for binding the controls to data in databases, Web services, and objects. For Word and Excel, Visual Studio adds support for actions panes, which can be used with a schema-mapped document to create an enhanced end-user experience for your solutions. For more information, see [Actions pane overview](../vsto/actions-pane-overview.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot use multipart XML schemas in Excel solutions.

## Objects created when schemas are attached to Excel workbooks
 When you attach a schema to a workbook, Visual Studio automatically creates several objects and adds them to your project. These objects should not be deleted using Visual Studio tools, because they are managed by Excel. To delete them, remove the mapped elements from the worksheet or detach the schema by using Excel tools.

 There are two main objects:

- XML schema (XSD file). For every schema in the workbook, Visual Studio adds a schema to the project. This appears as a project item with an XSD extension in **Solution Explorer**.

- A typed <xref:System.Data.DataSet> class. This class is created based on the schema. This dataset class is visible in **Class View**.

## Objects created when schema elements are mapped to Excel worksheets
 When you map a schema element from the **XML Source** task pane to a worksheet, Visual Studio automatically creates several objects and adds them to your project:

- Controls. For every mapped object in the workbook, an <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.XmlMappedRange> control (for non-repeating schema elements) or a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> control (for repeating schema elements) is created in the programming model. The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> control can be deleted only by deleting the mappings and the mapped objects from the workbook. For more information about controls, see [Host items and host controls overview](../vsto/host-items-and-host-controls-overview.md).

- BindingSource. When you create an <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.XmlMappedRange> by mapping a non-repeating schema element to the worksheet, a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is created and the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.XmlMappedRange> control is bound to the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>. You must bind the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> to an instance of the data source that matches the schema mapped to the document, such as an instance of the typed <xref:System.Data.DataSet> class that was created. Create the binding by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataSource%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataMember%2A> properties, which are exposed in the **Properties** window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> is not created for <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> objects. You must manually bind the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> to the data source by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataSource%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataMember%2A> properties in the **Properties** window.

### Office mapped schemas and the Visual Studio Data Sources window
 Both the mapped schema functionality of Office and the Visual Studio **Data Sources** window can help you present data on an Excel worksheet for reporting or editing. In both cases you can drag data elements onto the Excel worksheet. Both methods create controls that are data bound through a <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource> to a data source such as a <xref:System.Data.DataSet> or a web service.

> [!NOTE]
> When you map a repeating schema element to a worksheet, Visual Studio creates a <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject>. The <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> is not automatically bound to data through the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource>. You must manually bind the <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject> to the data source by setting the <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataSource%2A> and <xref:System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource.DataMember%2A> properties in the **Properties** window.

 The following table shows some of the differences between the two methods.

|XML schema|Data Sources window|
|----------------|-------------------------|
|Uses Office interface.|Uses **Data Sources** window in Visual Studio.|
|Enables the built-in Office features for importing and exporting data from XML files.|You must provide import and export functionality programmatically.|
|You must write code to fill the generated controls with data.|Controls added from the **Data Sources** window have code generated automatically to fill them, along with the necessary connection strings when you use database servers.|

## Behavior when schemas are attached to Word documents
 Data objects are not created when you attach a schema to a Word document that is used in a document-level Office project. However, when you map a schema element to your document, controls are created. The type of control depends on what type of element you map; repeating elements generate <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.XMLNodes> controls, and non-repeating elements generate <xref:Microsoft.Office.Tools.Word.XMLNode> controls. For more information, see [XMLNodes Control](../vsto/xmlnodes-control.md) and [XMLNode Control](../vsto/xmlnode-control.md).

## Deployment of solutions that include XML schemas
 You should create an installer to deploy a solution that uses an XML schema that is mapped to a document. The installer should register the schema in the schema library on the user's computer. If you do not register the schema, the solution will still work because Word generates a temporary schema based on the elements that are in the document when the user opens it. However, the user will not be able to perform validation against or save the schema that was used to create the project. For more information about installers, see [Deploy applications, services, and components](../deployment/deploying-applications-services-and-components.md).

 You can also add code to your project to check whether the schema is in the library and registered. If it is not, you can warn the user.
