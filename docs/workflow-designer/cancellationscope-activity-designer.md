# CancellationScope Activity Designer

The **CancellationScope** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope> activity.

## The CancellationScope Activity

The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope> activity allows you to specify an activity for execution and cancellation logic for that activity.

### Using the CancellationScope Activity Designer

The **CancellationScope** activity designer can be found in the **Transaction** category of **Toolbox**. To open **Toolbox**, select the **Toolbox** tab of the Workflow Designer. Alternatively, select **Toolbox** from the **View** menu, or press **Ctrl**+**Alt**+**X**.

The **CancellationScope** activity designer can be dragged from **Toolbox** and dropped on to the Workflow Designer surface wherever activities are placed, such as inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>. Dropping the **CancellationScope** activity designer creates a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope> activity with a default <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> of CancellationScope. Edit the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> value in the header of the **CancellationScope** activity designer. You can also edit it in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid.

### The CancellationScope Properties

The following table shows the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope> properties and describes how they are used in the designer. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> property can be edited in property grid but the other properties must be edited on Workflow Designer surface.

|Property Name|Required|Usage|
|-|--------------|-|
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A>|False|The optional friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope> activity. The default is CancellationScope. Although the <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> value is not strictly required, it is a best practice to use one.|
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope.Body%2A>|True|Specifies the activity for which cancellation logic is provided. To add the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope.Body%2A> activity, drop an activity from **Toolbox** into the **Body** box on the **CancellationScope** activity designer. Add the hint text "Drop Activity Here".|
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope.CancellationHandler%2A>|True|Specifies the activity that is executed if there's a cancellation. To add the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.CancellationScope.CancellationHandler%2A> activity, drop an activity from **Toolbox** into the **CancellationHandler** box on the **CancellationScope** activity designer. Add the hint text "Drop Activity Here".|
