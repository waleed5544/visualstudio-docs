# Throw Activity Designer

The **Throw** activity designer is used to create and configure a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw> activity.

## The Throw Activity

The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw> activity throws an exception.

### Using the Throw Activity Designer

Access the **Throw** activity designer in the **Error Handling** category of the **Toolbox**.

The **Throw** activity designer can be dragged from the **Toolbox** and dropped on to the Workflow Designer surface wherever activities are usually placed, such as inside a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Sequence>. This creates a <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw> activity with a default **DisplayName** of Throw. The <xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A> value can be edited in the header of the **Throw** activity designer or in the **DisplayName** box of the property grid. The <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw.Exception%2A> property must be edited on the property grid.

### The Throw Properties

The following table shows the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw> properties and describes how they are used in the designer.

|Property Name|Required|Usage|
|-|--------------|-|
|<xref:System.Activities.Activity.DisplayName%2A>|False|Specifies the optional friendly name of the <xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw> activity. The default is Throw.|
|<xref:System.Activities.Statements.Throw.Exception%2A>|True|The exception to throw. This exception must derive from <xref:System.Exception>. To specify the exception, type a Visual Basic expression in the property grid.|
