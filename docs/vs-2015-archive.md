# Visual Studio 2015 documentation

As of October 13, 2020, the Visual Studio 2015 documentation has been moved to the [previous-versions archive](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015). This date marks the end of Mainstream Support for this product. On that date, Visual Studio 2015 entered Extended Support. According to documentation retention policy, during the Extended Support period, documentation for older versions of Visual Studio is available on the docs site in the archive location (previous-versions in the URL), rather than on the main site. For more information about product lifecycle policies, see [Fixed Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/policies/fixed) and [Support for older versions of Visual Studio](/visualstudio/releases/2019/servicing#support-for-older-versions-of-visual-studio).What this means is that Visual Studio 2015 articles no longer appear in the version selector on this site, and are no longer indexed in search engines. To search in the archived content, or find a specific article for Visual Studio 2015:

1. Navigate to the Visual Studio 2015 content at [previous-versions archive](/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2015).

1. To search in the Visual Studio 2015 content, use the site search box at the top right.

1. To search titles only, enter keywords into the **Filter by title** box near the table of contents.

We recommend upgrading to the latest version, Visual Studio 2019. To download, see [Visual Studio downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

In the Visual Studio 2015 IDE, F1 Help functionality should continue to work. If you encounter any issues, use the Docs Feedback link at the bottom of this page to create an issue our GitHub repo.

If you are using Visual Studio 2015 docs frequently, you might want to explore the option of using the Help viewer and downloading the offline Help books for that version. See [Microsoft Help viewer](./help-viewer/overview.md).
