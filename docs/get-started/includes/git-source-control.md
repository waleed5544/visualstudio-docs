## Add Git source control

Now that you've created an app, you might want to add it to a Git repository. We've got you covered. Visual Studio makes that process easy with Git tools you can use directly from the IDE.

> [!TIP]
> Git is the most widely used modern version control system, so whether you're a professional developer or you're learning how to code, Git can be very useful. If you're new to Git, the [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) website is a good place to start. There, you can find cheat sheets, a popular online book, and Git Basics videos.

To associate your code with Git, you start by creating a new Git repository where your code is located. Here's how:

1. In the status bar at the bottom-right corner of Visual Studio, select **Add to Source Control**, and then select **Git**.

1. In the **Create a Git repository** dialog box, sign in to GitHub.

    The repository name auto-populates based on your folder location. By default, your new repository is private, which means you're the only one who can access it.

    > [!TIP]
    > Whether your repository is public or private, it's best to have a remote backup of your code stored securely on GitHub. Even if you aren't working with a team, a remote repository makes your code available to you from any computer.

1. Select **Create and Push**.

    After you create your repository, you see status details in the status bar.

    The first icon with the arrows shows how many outgoing/incoming commits are in your current branch. You can use this icon to pull any incoming commits or push any outgoing commits. You can also choose to view these commits first. To do so, select the icon, and then select **View Outgoing/Incoming**.

    The second icon with the pencil shows the number of uncommitted changes to your code. You can select this icon to view those changes in the **Git Changes** window.

To learn more about how to use Git with your app, see the [Visual Studio version control documentation](../../version-control/index.yml).
