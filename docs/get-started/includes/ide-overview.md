An *integrated development environment* (IDE) is a feature-rich program that supports many aspects of software development. The Visual Studio IDE is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build code, and then publish an app. Over and above the standard editor and debugger that most IDEs provide, Visual Studio includes compilers, code completion tools, graphical designers, and many more features to enhance the software development process.

::: moniker-end

The preceding image shows Visual Studio with an open project that shows key windows and their functionality:

- In [Solution Explorer](../../ide/use-solution-explorer.md), at upper right, you can view, navigate, and manage your code files. **Solution Explorer** can help organize your code by grouping the files into [solutions and projects](../../ide/solutions-and-projects-in-visual-studio.md).

- The central [editor window](../../ide/writing-code-in-the-code-and-text-editor.md), where you'll probably spend most of your time, displays file contents. In the editor window, you can edit code or design a user interface such as a window with buttons and text boxes.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

- The [Output window](../../ide/reference/output-window.md) (bottom center) is where Visual Studio sends notifications such as debugging and error messages, compiler warnings, publishing status messages, and more. Each message source has its own tab.

::: moniker-end

- In [Git Changes](/visualstudio/version-control/) at lower right, you can track work items and share code with others by using version control technologies like [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/github).

## Editions

Visual Studio is available for Windows and Mac. [Visual Studio for Mac](/visualstudio/mac/) has many of the same features as Visual Studio for Windows, and is optimized for developing cross-platform and mobile apps. This article focuses on the Windows version of Visual Studio.

There are three editions of Visual Studio: Community, Professional, and Enterprise. See [Compare Visual Studio editions](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/compare/) to learn about which features are supported in each edition.

## Popular productivity features

Some popular features in Visual Studio that improve your productivity when developing software include:

- Squiggles and [Quick Actions](../../ide/quick-actions.md)

   Squiggles are wavy underlines that alert you to errors or potential problems in your code as you type. These visual clues help you fix problems immediately, without waiting to discover errors during build or runtime. If you hover over a squiggle, you see more information about the error. A lightbulb might also appear in the left margin showing *Quick Actions* you can take to fix the error.

::: moniker range="vs-2019"
- Code Cleanup

   With the click of a button, you can format your code and apply any code fixes suggested by your [code style settings](../../ide/reference/options-text-editor-csharp-formatting.md), [.editorconfig conventions](../../ide/create-portable-custom-editor-options.md), and [Roslyn analyzers](../../code-quality/roslyn-analyzers-overview.md). **Code Cleanup**, currently available for C# code only, helps you resolve issues in your code before it goes to code review.

   ::: moniker-end

- [IntelliSense](../../ide/using-intellisense.md)

   IntelliSense is a set of features that display information about your code directly in the editor and, in some cases, write small bits of code for you. It's like having basic documentation inline in the editor, so you don't have to look up type information elsewhere.

   The following illustration shows how IntelliSense displays a member list for a type:

   ::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
   ![Screenshot that shows an IntelliSense member list.](../media/intellisense-list-members.png)

   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
   ![Screenshot that shows an IntelliSense member list.](../media/vs-2022/intellisense-list-members.png)
   ::: moniker-end

   IntelliSense features vary by language. For more information, see [C# IntelliSense](../../ide/visual-csharp-intellisense.md), [Visual C++ IntelliSense](../../ide/visual-cpp-intellisense.md), [JavaScript IntelliSense](../../ide/javascript-intellisense.md), and [Visual Basic IntelliSense](../../ide/visual-basic-specific-intellisense.md).

- [Visual Studio search](../../ide/visual-studio-search.md)

   Visual Studio menus, options, and properties can seem overwhelming at times. Visual Studio search, or **Ctrl**+**Q**, is a great way to rapidly find IDE features and code in one place.

- [Live Share](/visualstudio/liveshare/)

   Collaboratively edit and debug with others in real time, regardless of your app type or programming language. You can instantly and securely share your project. You can also share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, voice calls, and more.

- [Call Hierarchy](../../ide/reference/call-hierarchy.md)

   The **Call Hierarchy** window shows the methods that call a selected method. This information can be useful when you're thinking about changing or removing the method, or when you're trying to track down a bug.

## Create a program

Dive in and create a simple program.

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

1. Open Visual Studio.

1. On the menu bar, choose **File** > **New** > **Project**.

   ![Screenshot that shows File > New Project on the menu bar.](../media/file-new-project-menu.png)

   The **New Project** dialog box shows several project *templates*. A template contains the basic files and settings needed for a given project type.

1. Choose the **.NET Core** template category under **Visual C#**, and then choose the **Console App (.NET Core)** template. In the **Name** text box, type **HelloWorld**, and then select the **OK** button.

   ![Screenshot that shows the .NET Core app template.](../media/overview-new-project-dialog.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't see the **.NET Core** category, you need to install the **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload. To do this, choose the **Open Visual Studio Installer** link on the bottom left of the **New Project** dialog. After Visual Studio Installer opens, scroll down and select the **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload, and then select **Modify**.

   Visual Studio creates the project. It's a simple "Hello World" application that calls the <xref:System.Console.WriteLine?displayProperty=nameWithType> method to display the literal string "Hello World!" in the console (program output) window.

   Shortly, you should see something like the following screen:

   ![Screenshot that shows the Visual Studio IDE.](../media/overview-ide-console-app.png)

   The C# code for your application shows in the editor window, which takes up most of the space. Notice that the text is automatically colorized to indicate different parts of the code, such as keywords and types. In addition, small, vertical dashed lines in the code indicate which braces match one another, and line numbers help you locate code later. You can choose the small, boxed minus signs to collapse or expand blocks of code. This code outlining feature lets you hide code you don't need, helping to minimize onscreen clutter. The project files are listed on the right side in a window called **Solution Explorer**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Visual Studio IDE with red boxes.](../media/overview-ide-console-app-red-boxes.png)

   There are other menus and tool windows available, but let's move on for now.

1. Now, start the app. You can do this by choosing **Start Without Debugging** from the **Debug** menu on the menu bar. You can also press **Ctrl**+**F5**.

   ![Screenshot that shows the Debug > Start without debugging menu.](../media/overview-start-without-debugging.png)

   Visual Studio builds the app, and a console window opens with the message **Hello World!**. You now have a running app!

   ![Screenshot of the cmd.exe console window showing the output 'Hello World!' and 'Press any key to continue'.](../media/overview-console-window.png)

1. To close the console window, press any key on your keyboard.

1. Let's add some more code to the app. Add the following C# code before the line that says `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");`:

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine("\nWhat is your name?");
   var name = Console.ReadLine();
   ```

   This code displays **What is your name?** in the console window, and then waits until the user enters some text followed by the **Enter** key.

1. Change the line that says `Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");` to the following code:

   ```csharp
   Console.WriteLine($"\nHello {name}!");
   ```

1. Run the app again by selecting **Debug** > **Start Without Debugging** or by pressing **Ctrl**+**F5**.

   Visual Studio rebuilds the app, and a console window opens and prompts you for your name.

1. Enter your name in the console window and press **Enter**.

   ![Screenshot that shows Console window input.](../media/overview-console-input.png)

1. Press any key to close the console window and stop the running program.

## Use refactoring and IntelliSense

Let's look at a couple of the ways that [refactoring](../../ide/refactoring-in-visual-studio.md) and [IntelliSense](../../ide/using-intellisense.md) can help you code more efficiently.

First, rename the `name` variable:

1. Double-click the `name` variable, and type the new name for the variable, *username*.

   A box appears around the variable, and a light bulb appears in the margin.

1. Select the light bulb icon to show the available [Quick Actions](../../ide/quick-actions.md). Select **Rename 'name' to 'username'**.

   ::: moniker range="vs-2017"
   ![Screenshot that shows the Rename action in Visual Studio.](../media/rename-quick-action.png)
   ::: moniker-end
   ::: moniker range="vs-2019"
   ![Screenshot that shows the Rename action in Visual Studio.](../media/vs-2019/rename-quick-action.png)

   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
   ![Screenshot that shows the Rename action in Visual Studio.](../media/vs-2022/rename-quick-action.png)
   ::: moniker-end

   The variable is renamed across the project, which in our case is only two places.

   ::: moniker range="vs-2017"
   ![Animated gif showing rename refactoring in Visual Studio.](../media/rename-refactoring.gif)
   ::: moniker-end

1. Now take a look at IntelliSense. Below the line that says `Console.WriteLine($"\nHello {username}!");`, type `DateTime now = DateTime.`.

   A box displays the members of the <xref:System.DateTime> class. The description of the currently selected member also displays in a separate box.

   ::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"
   ![Screenshot that shows IntelliSense list members in Visual Studio.](../media/intellisense-list-members.png)
   ::: moniker-end
   ::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"
   ![Screenshot that shows IntelliSense list members in Visual Studio.](../media/vs-2022/intellisense-list-members.png)
   ::: moniker-end

1. Select the member named **Now**, which is a property of the class, by double-clicking it or pressing **Tab**. Complete the line of code by adding a semicolon to the end of the line: `DateTime now = DateTime.Now;`.

1. Below that line, enter the following lines of code:

   ```csharp
   int dayOfYear = now.DayOfYear;

   Console.Write("Day of year: ");
   Console.WriteLine(dayOfYear);
   ```

   > [!TIP]
   > <xref:System.Console.Write%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> is different from <xref:System.Console.WriteLine%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> in that it doesn't add a line terminator after it prints. That means that the next piece of text that's sent to the output will print on the same line. You can hover over each of these methods in your code to see their descriptions.

1. Next, use refactoring again to make the code a little more concise. Select the variable `now` in the line `DateTime now = DateTime.Now;`. A screwdriver icon appears in the margin on that line.

1. Select the screwdriver icon to see available suggestions from Visual Studio. This case shows the [Inline temporary variable](../../ide/reference/inline-temporary-variable.md) refactoring to remove a line of code without changing the overall code behavior.

## Debug code

When you write code, you should run it and test it for bugs. Visual Studio's debugging system lets you step through code one statement at a time and inspect variables as you go. You can set *breakpoints* that stop execution of the code at a particular line, and observe how the variable value changes as the code runs.

Set a breakpoint to see the value of the `username` variable while the program is running.

1. Set a breakpoint on the line of code that says `Console.WriteLine($"\nHello {username}!");` by clicking in the far-left margin, or gutter, next to the line. You can also select the line of code and then press **F9**.

   A red circle appears in the gutter, and the line is highlighted.

1. Start debugging by selecting **Debug** > **Start Debugging** or pressing **F5**.

1. When the console window appears and asks for your name, enter your name.

   The focus returns to the Visual Studio code editor, and the line of code with the breakpoint is highlighted in yellow. The yellow highlight means that this line of code will execute next. The breakpoint makes the app pause execution at this line.

1. Hover your mouse over the `username` variable to see its value. You can also right-click on `username` and select **Add Watch** to add the variable to the **Watch** window, where you can also see its value.
