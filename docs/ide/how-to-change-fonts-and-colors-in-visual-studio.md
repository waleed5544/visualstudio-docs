# How to: Change fonts, colors, and themes in Visual Studio

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"

You can change the fonts and the colors in Visual Studio in several ways. For example, you can change the default dark theme (also referred to as "dark mode") to a light theme, a blue theme, an extra-contrast theme, or a theme that matches your system settings. You can also change the default font and text size in both the IDE and the code editor.

> [!TIP]
> See the [**Weâ€™ve upgraded the UI in Visual Studio 2022**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/weve-upgraded-the-ui-in-visual-studio-2022/) blog post to learn more about the subtle color contrast ratio adjustments and a new Cascadia Code font we've added to make Visual Studio more accessible for everyone.

You can change the fonts and the colors in Visual Studio in many ways. For example, you can change the default blue color theme to the dark theme (also referred to as "dark mode"). You can also select an extra-contrast theme if that best suits your needs. And, you can change the default font and text size in both the IDE and the code editor.

## Change the color theme

Here's how to change the color theme of the IDE frame and the tool windows in Visual Studio.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2022"

1. On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**.

1. In the options list, choose **Environment** > **General**.

1. In the **Color theme** list, choose either the default **Dark** theme, the **Light** theme, the **Blue** theme, or the **Blue (Extra Contrast)** theme.

   You can also choose to use the theme that Windows uses by selecting **Use system setting**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > When you change a color theme, text in the IDE reverts to the default or previously customized fonts and sizes for that theme.

    > [!TIP]
    > Want even more themes to choose from? Check out the wide range of custom themes on the [**Visual Studio Marketplace**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?target=VS&category=Tools&vsVersion=&subCategory=Themes&sortBy=Installs). And to see examples of new Visual Studio 2022 custom themes based on VS Code, take a look at the [**Introducing a collection of new Visual Studio themes**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/custom-themes/) blog post.

    > [!TIP]
    > You can create and edit your own Visual Studio themes by using an extension. Choose from either of the following two options, depending on the version of Visual Studio you're using:
    > - [Color Theme Designer for Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner).
    > - [Color Theme Editor for Visual Studio 2017](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2017ColorThemeEditor)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you want to change the font for tool windows only, in the **Show settings for** list, choose **All Text Tool Windows**.

## Accessibility options

::: moniker range="vs-2022"

In a neurodiverse world, we want to support our different learners and low-vision users by offering the following font options and color themes:

- You can use the [Cascadia Code](#use-the-cascadia-code-font) font, which adds more weight to the proportions of letters, numerals, and characters to help disambiguate them. Cascadia Code also includes coding ligatures.
- You can choose to use a [high-contrast](#use-windows-high-contrast) color theme for *all* the apps and UI on a computer, or an [extra-contrast](#use-visual-studio-extra-contrast) color theme for Visual Studio only.

### Use the Cascadia Code font

The new [**Cascadia Code**](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code#welcome) font includes **Cascade Mono**, which is the default font in Visual Studio 2022. Not only are both of these fonts easier to read, but the Cascadia Code font also includes coding ligatures that turn a sequence of characters into a glyph. Coding ligatures, or glyphs, make it easier for people to cognitively associate the meaning behind them.

The following screenshot shows an example of the default Cascadia Mono font and lists a series of characters, to include mathematical symbols, that you might find yourself using while you code.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/cascadia-mono-font.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an example of the Cascadia Mono font in the Editor.":::

The following screenshot shows an example of the Cascadia Code font, where the same series of characters shown previously are now converted to coding ligatures, or glyphs.

:::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/cascadia-code-font.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an example of the Cascadia Code font in the Editor.":::

Notice that the last line of text in the Cascadia Code screenshot shows how the space between duplicate characters is reduced, which also makes them easier to read.

Here's how to toggle between the Cascadia fonts:

1. Go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Fonts and colors**.

1. From the **Font** dropdown list, select either the **Cascadia Code** font or the **Cascadia Mono** font you want, and then select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/vs-2022/cascadia-font-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Cascadia fonts available from the Options dialog box.":::

::: moniker range="<=vs-2019"

There are color theme options for you if you experience low vision. You can use a high-contrast option for *all* the apps and UI on a computer, or an extra contrast option for Visual Studio only.

::: moniker-end

### Use Windows high contrast

Use either of the following procedures to toggle the Windows high contrast option:

- In Windows or in any Microsoft application, press the **Left Alt**+**Left Shift**+**PrtScn** keys.

- In Windows, choose **Start** > **Settings** > **Ease of Access**. Then, under the **Vision** section in Windows 10 and later, choose **High contrast**.

    > [!WARNING]
    > The Windows high contrast setting affects all applications and UI on the computer.

### Use Visual Studio extra contrast

Use the following procedures to toggle the Visual Studio extra contrast option:

1. On the menu bar in Visual Studio, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and then, in the options list, choose **Environment** > **General**.

1. In the **Color theme** drop-down list, choose the **Blue (Extra Contrast)** theme, and then choose **OK**.

To learn more about other Visual Studio accessibility options available to you, see the [Accessibility features of Visual Studio](../ide/reference/accessibility-features-of-visual-studio.md) page.

> [!TIP]
> If there is an accessibility option for colors or fonts that you think might be useful but isn't currently available in Visual Studio, please let us know by selecting **Suggest a feature** in the [Visual Studio Developer Community](https://aka.ms/feedback/suggest?space=8). For more information about this forum and how it works, see the [Suggest a feature](../ide/suggest-a-feature.md) page.

## Next steps

To learn more details about all the user interface (UI) elements for which you can change font and color schemes, see the [Fonts and Colors, Environment, Options Dialog Box](../ide/reference/fonts-and-colors-environment-options-dialog-box.md) page.
