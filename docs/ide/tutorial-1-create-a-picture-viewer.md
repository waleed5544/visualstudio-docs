# Tutorial 1: Create a picture viewer

In this tutorial, you build an app that loads a picture from a file and displays it in a window. You learn how to use the **Windows Forms Designer** to drag controls like buttons and picture boxes on to your form, set their properties, and use containers to smoothly resize the form. You also get started writing code.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial covers both C# and Visual Basic, so focus on the information that's specific to the programming language you're using.

This tutorial walks you through the following tasks:

* Create a new project.

* Test (debug) an application.

* Add basic controls like check boxes and buttons to a form.

* Position controls on a form by using layouts.

* Add **Open File** and **Color** dialog boxes to a form.

* Write code by using IntelliSense and code snippets.

* Write event handler methods.

When you finish, your app should look similar to the following image:
