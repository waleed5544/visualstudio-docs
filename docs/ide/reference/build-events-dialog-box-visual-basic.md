# Build Events Dialog Box (Visual Basic)

Use the **Build Events** dialog box to specify build configuration instructions. You can also specify the conditions under which any pre-build or post-build events are run. For more information, see [How to: Specify Build Events (Visual Basic)](../../ide/how-to-specify-build-events-visual-basic.md).

**Pre-build event command line**

Specifies any commands to execute before the build starts. To type long commands, click **Edit Pre-build** to display the [Pre-build Event/Post-build Event Command Line Dialog Box](../../ide/reference/pre-build-event-post-build-event-command-line-dialog-box.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Pre-build events do not run if the project is up-to-date and no build is triggered.

**Post-build event command line**

Specifies any commands to execute after the build ends. To type long commands, click **Edit Post-build** to display the **Pre-build Event/Post-build Event Command Line** dialog box.

> [!NOTE]
> Add a `call` statement before all post-build commands that run .bat files. For example, `call C:\MyFile.bat` or `call C:\MyFile.bat call C:\MyFile2.bat`.

**Run the post-build event**

Specifies the conditions for the post-build event to run, as shown in the following table.

|Option|Result|
|------------|------------|
|**Always**|Post-build event will run, regardless of whether the build succeeds.|
|**On successful build**|Post-build event will run if the build succeeds. The event will run even for a project that is up-to-date, as long as the build succeeds. This is the default setting.|
|**When the build updates the project output**|Post-build event will run only when the compiler's output file (.exe or .dll) differs from the previous compiler output file. A post-build event is not run if a project is up-to-date.|
