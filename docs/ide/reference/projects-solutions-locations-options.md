# Options dialog box: Projects and Solutions \> Locations

Use this page to set default locations for projects, project templates, and item templates. To access these options, select **Tools** > **Options**, expand **Projects and Solutions**, and then select **Locations**.

The following options are available on the **Locations** page.

## Projects location

Specifies the default location where Visual Studio creates new projects and solution folders. Several dialog boxes also use the location set in this option for folder starting points. For example, the **Open Project** dialog box uses this location for the **My Projects** shortcut.

## User project templates location

Specifies the default location that's used to search for user-created project templates. For more information, see [How to: Locate and Organize Templates](../../ide/how-to-locate-and-organize-project-and-item-templates.md).

## User item templates location

Specifies the default location that's used to search for user-created item templates. For more information, see [How to: Locate and Organize Templates](../../ide/how-to-locate-and-organize-project-and-item-templates.md).
