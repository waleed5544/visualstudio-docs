# Options dialog box: Environment \> International Settings

The International Settings page lets you change the default language when you have more than one language version of the integrated development environment (IDE) installed on your machine. You can access this dialog box by selecting **Options** from the **Tools** menu and then choosing **International Settings** from the **Environment** folder.

**Language**

Lists the available languages for the installed product language versions. If multiple languages of products or a mixed language installation of products share the environment, the language selection is changed to **Same as Microsoft Windows**.

> [!CAUTION]
> In a system with multiple languages installed, the Visual C++ build tools (cl.exe, link.exe, nmake.exe, bscmake.exe and related files) are not affected by this setting. These tools use the version for the last language installed. The build tools for the previously installed language are overwritten because the Visual C++ build tools do not use the satellite DLL model.
