# Options dialog box: Environment \> Documents

Use this page of the **Options** dialog box to control the display of documents in the integrated development environment (IDE) and manage external changes to documents and files. You can access this dialog box by clicking **Options** on the **Tools** menu and then selecting **Environment** > **Documents**.

**Detect when file is changed outside the environment**

When this option is selected, a message immediately notifies you of changes to an open file that have been made by an editor outside the IDE. The message lets you reload the file from storage.

**Reload modified files unless there are unsaved changes**

When you have **Detect when file is changed outside the environment** selected and an open file in the IDE changes outside the IDE, a warning message is generated by default. If this option is enabled, no warning appears and the document is reloaded in the IDE to pick up the external changes.

**Allow editing of read-only files; warn when attempt to save**

When this option is enabled, you can open and edit a read-only file. When you are finished, you must use the **Save As** command to save the file by a new name if you want to save a record of your changes.

**Open file using directory of currently active document**

When selected, this option specifies that the **Open File** dialog box displays the directory of the active document. When this option is cleared, the **Open File** dialog box displays the directory last used to open a file.

**Check for consistent line endings on load**

Select this option to have the editor scan the line endings in a file and display a message box if inconsistencies are detected in how line endings are formatted.

**Display warning when global undo will modify edited files**

Select this option to display a message box when the **Global Undo** command will roll back refactoring changes made in files that also were changed after the refactoring operation. Returning a file to its pre-refactoring state might discard subsequent changes made in the file.

**Show Miscellaneous files in Solution Explorer**

Select this option to display the **Miscellaneous Files** node in **Solution Explorer**. Miscellaneous files are files that are not associated with a project or solution but can appear in **Solution Explorer** for your convenience.

> [!NOTE]
> Select this option to enable the **View in Browser** command on the **File** menu for web documents not included in the active web application.

**Items saved in the Miscellaneous files project**

Specifies the number of files to persist in the **Miscellaneous Files** folder of **Solution Explorer**. These files are listed even if they are no longer open in an editor. You can specify any whole number from 0 to 256. The default number is 0.

For example, if you set this option to 5 and have 10 miscellaneous files open, when you close all 10 files, the first 5 will still be shown in the **Miscellaneous Files** folder.

**Save documents as Unicode when data cannot be saved in codepage**

Select this option to cause files containing information incompatible with the selected codepage to be saved as Unicode by default.
