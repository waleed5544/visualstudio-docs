# Team Explorer reference

This article provides links to Azure DevOps articles about the various functions in **Team Explorer**.

Use the **Team Explorer** tool window to coordinate your code efforts with other team members to develop a project, and to manage work that's assigned to you, your team, or your projects. **Team Explorer** connects Visual Studio to Git and GitHub repositories, Team Foundation version control (TFVC) repositories, and projects hosted on [Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops-services) or an on-premises [Azure DevOps Server](/azure/devops/index-all) (formerly known as TFS). You can manage source code, work items, and builds.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting with the release of Visual Studio 2019 [**version 16.8**](/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-history), the Git version control experience is the default. If you'd like to learn more about how it compares with Team Explorer, see the [**Side-by-side comparison of Git and Team Explorer**](../../version-control/git-team-explorer-feature-comparison.md) page.

## Home page

After you [connect to a project](../connect-team-project.md) in **Team Explorer**, the following links become available in the **Project** section:

- [Clone repository](/azure/devops/repos/git/clone)
- [Web Portal](/azure/devops/project/navigation/index)
- [Task Board](/azure/devops/boards/sprints/task-board)

The **Home** page has different functions depending on whether you're connected to a [Git](/azure/devops/repos/git/gitquickstart?view=vsts&tabs=visual-studio&preserve-view=true) or [Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)](/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/overview) repository.

> [!TIP]
> For a comparison of the two version control systems, see [Choose the right version control for your project (Azure DevOps)](/azure/devops/repos/tfvc/comparison-git-tfvc).
