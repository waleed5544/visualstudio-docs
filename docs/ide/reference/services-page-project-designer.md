# Services Page, Project Designer

Client application services provide simplified access to [!INCLUDE[ajax_current_short](../../ide/reference/includes/ajax_current_short_md.md)] login, roles, and profile services from Windows Forms and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) applications. You can use the **Services** page of the **Project Designer** to enable and configure client application services for your project.

With client application services, you can use a centralized server to authenticate users, determine each user's assigned role or roles, and store per-user application settings that you can share across the network. For more information, see [Client Application Services](/dotnet/framework/common-client-technologies/client-application-services).

To access the **Services** page, select a project node in **Solution Explorer**, and then click **Properties** on the **Project** menu. When the **Project Designer** appears, click the **Services** tab.

## UIElement List

 **Configuration**

This control is not editable on this page. For a description of this control, see [Compile Page, Project Designer (Visual Basic)](../../ide/reference/compile-page-project-designer-visual-basic.md) or [Build Page, Project Designer (C#)](../../ide/reference/build-page-project-designer-csharp.md).

 **Platform**

This control is not editable on this page. For a description of this control, see [Compile Page, Project Designer (Visual Basic)](../../ide/reference/compile-page-project-designer-visual-basic.md) or [Build Page, Project Designer (C#)](../../ide/reference/build-page-project-designer-csharp.md).

 **Enable client application services**

Select to enable client application services. You must specify service locations on the **Services** page to use client application services.

 **Use Windows authentication**

Indicates that the authentication provider will use Windows-based authentication, that is, the identity supplied by the Windows operating system.

 **Use Forms authentication**

Indicates that the authentication provider will use forms authentication. This means that your application must provide a user interface for login. For more information, see [How to: Implement User Login with Client Application Services](/dotnet/framework/common-client-technologies/how-to-implement-user-login-with-client-application-services).

 **Authentication service location**

Used only with forms authentication. Specifies the location of the authentication service.

 **Optional: Credentials provider**

Used only with forms authentication. Indicates the <xref:System.Web.ClientServices.Providers.IClientFormsAuthenticationCredentialsProvider> implementation that the authentication service will use to display a login dialog box when your application calls the `static`<xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.ValidateUser%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method and passes empty strings or `null` for the parameters. If you leave this box blank, you must pass a valid user name and password to the <xref:System.Web.Security.Membership.ValidateUser%2A?displayProperty=fullName> method. You must specify the credentials provider as an assembly-qualified type name. For more information, see <xref:System.Type.AssemblyQualifiedName%2A?displayProperty=fullName> and [Assembly Names](/dotnet/framework/app-domains/assembly-names). In its simplest form, an assembly-qualified type name looks similar to the following example: `MyNamespace.MyLoginClass, MyAssembly`

 **Roles service location**

Specifies the location of the roles service.

 **Web settings service location**

Specifies the location of the profile (web settings) service.

 **Advanced**

Opens the [Advanced Settings for Services Dialog Box](../../ide/reference/advanced-settings-for-services-dialog-box.md), which you can use to override default behavior. For example, you can use this dialog box to specify a database for offline storage instead of using the local file system. For more information, see [Advanced Settings for Services Dialog Box](../../ide/reference/advanced-settings-for-services-dialog-box.md).
