# Generate a field, property, or local variable in Visual Studio

This code generation applies to:

- C#

- Visual Basic

**What:** Lets you immediately generate the code for a previously undeclared field, property, or local.

**When:** You introduce a new field, property or local while typing and want to properly declare it, automatically.

**Why:** You could declare the field, property or local before using it, however this feature will generate the declaration and type automatically.

## How-to

1. Place your cursor on the line where there is a red squiggle. The red squiggle indicates a field, local or property that doesn't yet exist.

   - C#:

2. Next, do one of the following:

   - **Keyboard**
      - Press **Ctrl**+**.** to trigger the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu.
   - **Mouse**
      - Right-click and select the **Quick Actions and Refactorings** menu.
      - Hover over the red squiggle and click the ![error light bulb](media/error-bulb.png) icon that appears.
      - Click the ![error light bulb](media/error-bulb.png) icon that appears in the left margin if the text cursor is already on the line with the red squiggle.

   > [!TIP]
   > Use the **Preview changes** link at the bottom of the preview window [to see all of the changes](../../ide/preview-changes.md) that will be made before making your selection.

   The field, property or local is created, with the type inferred from its usage.
