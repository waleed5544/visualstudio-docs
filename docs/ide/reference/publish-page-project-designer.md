# Publish Page, Project Designer

The **Publish** page of the **Project Designer** is used to configure properties for ClickOnce deployment.

To access the **Publish** page, select a project node in **Solution Explorer**, and then, on the **Project** menu, click **Properties**. When the **Project Designer** appears, click the **Publish** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> Some of the ClickOnce properties described here can also be set in the **PublishWizard**, available from the **Build** menu or by clicking the **PublishWizard** button on this page.

## UIElement List

 **Publishing Folder Location**

Specifies the location where the application is published. Can be a drive path (`C:\deploy\myapplication`), a file share (`\\server\myapplication`), or an FTP server (`ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/myapplication`). Note that text must be present in the **Publishing Location** box in order for the browse (**...**) button to work.

 **Installation Folder URL**

Optional. Specifies a website to which users go to install the application. This is necessary only when it differs from the **Publishing Location**, for example, when the application is published to a staging server.

 **Install Mode and Settings**

Determines whether the application is run directly from the **Publishing Location** (when **The application is available online only** is selected) or is installed and added to the **Start** menu and the **Add or Remove Programs** item in **Control Panel** (when **The application is available offline as well** is selected).

For WPF web browser apps, the **The application is available offline as well** option is disabled, because such applications are available only online.

 **Application Files**

Opens the Application Files dialog box, which is used to specify how and where individual files are installed.

 **Prerequisites**

Opens the Prerequisites dialog box, which is used to specify prerequisite components, such as the .NET Framework, to be installed together with the application.

 **Updates**

Opens the Application Updates dialog box, which is used to specify update behavior for the application. Not available when **The application is available online only** is selected.

 **Options**

Opens the Publish Options dialog box, which is used to specify additional advanced publishing options.

 **Publish Version**

Sets the publish version number for the application; when the version number is changed, the application is published as an update. Each part of the publish version (**Major**, **Minor**, **Build**, **Revision**) can have a maximum value of 65355 (<xref:System.UInt16.MaxValue>), the maximum allowed by <xref:System.Version>.

When you install more than one version of an application by using ClickOnce, the installation moves earlier versions of the application into a folder named Archive, in the publish location that you specify. Archiving earlier versions in this manner keeps the installation directory clear of folders from the earlier version.

 **Automatically increment revision with each publish**

Optional. When this option is selected (the default), the **Revision** part of the publish version number is incremented by one every time that the application is published. This causes the application to be published as an update.

 **Publish Wizard**

Opens the Publish Wizard. Completing the Publish Wizard has the same effect as running the **Publish** command on the **Build** menu.

 **Publish Now**

Publishes the application using the current settings. Equivalent to the **Finish** button in the **PublishWizard**.
