# Step 2: Run your picture viewer app

When you create a Windows Forms App project, you actually build a program that runs. In this tutorial, your picture viewer app doesn't do much yet&mdash;although it will. For now, it displays an empty window that shows **Form1** in the title bar.

Here's how to run your app. 

1. Choose one of the following methods:

    - Choose the **F5** key.

    - On the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Start Debugging**.

    - On the toolbar, choose the **Start Debugging** button, which appears as follows:

      ![Start Debugging toolbar button](../ide/media/express_icondebug.png)<br>
      ***Start Debugging*** *toolbar button*

1. Visual Studio runs your app, and a window called **Form1** appears. The following screenshot shows the app you just built. The app is running, and you'll soon add to it.

***Windows Forms App***, *running*

1. Go back to the Visual Studio integrated development environment (IDE), and then look at the new toolbar. Additional buttons appear on the toolbar when you run an application. These buttons let you do things like stop and start your app, and help you track down any errors (bugs) it may have. For this example, we're using it to start and stop the app.

***Debugging*** *toolbar*

1. Use one of the following methods to stop your app:

    - On the toolbar, choose the **Stop Debugging** button.

    - On the menu bar, choose **Debug** > **Stop Debugging**.

    - Use your keyboard and press **Shift**+**F5**.

    - Choose the **X** button in the upper corner of the **Form1** window.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you run your app from inside the IDE, it's called debugging because you typically do so to locate and fix bugs (errors) in the application. Although this app is small and doesn't do much yet, it's still a real program. You follow the same procedure to run and debug other programs. To learn more about debugging, see [First look at the debugger](../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md).
