# Visual Studio productivity guide for C# developers

Learn how Visual Studio makes developers more productive than ever. Take advantage of our performance and productivity improvements like navigation to decompiled assemblies, variable name suggestions as you type, a hierarchy-view in **Test Explorer**, Go To All (**Ctrl**+**T**) to navigate to file/type/member/symbol declarations, an intelligent **Exception Helper**, code style configuration and enforcement, and many refactorings and code fixes.

## I'm used to keyboard shortcuts from a different editor

::: moniker range="vs-2017"

**New in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.8**

::: moniker-end

If you're coming from another IDE or coding environment, you can change your keyboard scheme to *Visual Studio Code* or *ReSharper (Visual Studio)*:

![Keyboard Schemes in Visual Studio](../ide/media/VS2017Guide-Keyboard.png)

Some extensions also offer keyboard schemes:

- [HotKeys for Visual Studio (ReSharper/IntelliJ)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JustinClareburtMSFT.HotKeys)
- [Emacs Emulation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JustinClareburtMSFT.EmacsEmulation)
- [VSVim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaredParMSFT.VsVim)

The following are popular Visual Studio shortcuts:

| Shortcut (All Profiles) | Command | Description |
|-|-|-|
| **Ctrl**+**T** | Go To All | Navigate to any file, type, member, or symbol declaration |
| **F12** (also **Ctrl**+**Click**) | Go To Definition | Navigate to where a symbol is defined |

| **Ctrl**+**Shift**+**/** | Toggle block comment/uncomment | This command adds or removes block comments depending on what you have selected |

> [!NOTE]
> Some extensions unbind the default Visual Studio keybindings. To use the above commands, restore your keybindings to Visual Studio's defaults by going to **Tools** > **Import and Export Settings** > **Reset all settings** or **Tools** > **Options** > **Keyboard** > **Reset**.

For more information about keyboard shortcuts and commands, see [Productivity shortcuts](../ide/productivity-shortcuts.md) and [Popular keyboard shortcuts](default-keyboard-shortcuts-in-visual-studio.md).

## Navigate quickly to files or types

Visual Studio has a feature called **Go To All** (**Ctrl**+**T**). **Go To All** enables you to quickly jump to any file, type, member, or symbol declaration.

- Change the location of this search bar or turn off the live navigation preview by using the **gear** icon.
- Filter results using syntax such as `t mytype`.
- Scope your search to just the current document.
- Camel case matching is supported.

![Go To All in Visual Studio](../ide/media/VS2017Guide-go-to-all.png)

## Enforce code style rules

You can use an EditorConfig file to codify coding conventions and have them travel with your source.

![Code style enforcement in Visual Studio](../ide/media/VSGuide_CodeStyle.png)

- Add a default or .NET-style EditorConfig file to your project by choosing **Add** > **New Item**. In the **Add New Item** dialog box, search for "editorconfig". Select either of the **editorconfig File** item templates and then choose **Add**.

   ![EditorConfig item templates in Visual Studio](media/editorconfig-item-templates.png)

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

- Automatically create an *.editorconfig* file based on your code style settings in **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **C#** > **Code Style**.

   ![Generate .editorconfig file from settings in VS 2019](media/vs-2019/generate-editorconfig-file.png)

::: moniker-end

- The [code inference feature](/visualstudio/intellicode/code-style-inference) of IntelliCode for Visual Studio infers your code styles from existing code. It then creates a non-empty EditorConfig file with your code-style preferences already defined.

- Configure the severity level of a code style rule directly through the editor. If you currently do not have an .editorconfig file, one will be generated for you. Place your cursor on the error, warning, or suggestion and type **Ctrl**+**.** to open the Quick Actions and Refactorings menu. Select **Configure or Suppress issues**. Then select the rule and choose the severity level you would like to configure for that rule. This will update your existing EditorConfig with the ruleâ€™s new severity.

   ![Configure the severity level of a code style rule directly in the editor](../ide/media/configure-severity-level.png)

Check out the [.NET coding convention options](/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/code-style-rule-options) documentation, which also contains an example of a complete EditorConfig file.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

## Code Cleanup

Visual Studio provides on-demand formatting of your code file, including code style preferences, through the **Code Cleanup** feature. To run Code Cleanup, click the broom icon at the bottom of the editor or press **Ctrl**+**K**, **Ctrl**+**E**.

![Code Cleanup button in Visual Studio 2019](media/execute-code-cleanup.png)

You can also run code cleanup across your entire project or solution. Right-click on the project or solution name in **Solution Explorer**, select **Analyze and Code Cleanup**, and then select **Run Code Cleanup**.

![Run Code Cleanup Across Entire Project or Solution](media/run-code-cleanup-project-solution.png)

In addition to formatting your file for spaces, indents, et cetera, **Code Cleanup** also applies selected code styles. Your preferences for each code style are read from the [EditorConfig file](code-styles-and-code-cleanup.md#code-styles-in-editorconfig-files), if you have one for the project, or from the [code style settings](code-styles-and-code-cleanup.md#code-styles-in-the-options-dialog-box) in the **Options** dialog box.

::: moniker-end

## Refactorings and code fixes

Visual Studio comes with numerous refactorings, code generation actions, and code fixes. Red squiggles represent errors, green squiggles represent warnings, and three gray dots represent code suggestions. You can access code fixes by clicking the light bulb or screwdriver icon, or by pressing **Ctrl**+**.** or **Alt**+**Enter**. Each fix comes with a preview window that shows a live code diff of how the fix works.

Popular quick fixes and refactorings include:

- Rename
- Extract Method
- Change Method Signature
- Generate Constructor
- Generate Method
- Move Type to File
- Add Null-Check
- Add Parameter
- Remove Unnecessary Usings
- Foreach Loop to LINQ Query or to LINQ method
- Pull Members Up

For more information, see [code generation features](code-generation-in-visual-studio.md).

You can [install FxCop analyzers](../code-quality/install-fxcop-analyzers.md) to flag code issues. Or, write your own refactoring or code fix with [Roslyn analyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/blob/master/docs/wiki/Getting-Started-Writing-a-Custom-Analyzer-&-Code-Fix.md).

Several community members have written free extensions that add additional code inspections:

## Find Usages, Go To Implementation, and Navigate To Decompiled Assemblies

Visual Studio has many features to help you search and [navigate your code](../ide/navigating-code.md).

| Feature | Shortcut | Details/Improvements |
|- | - | -|
| Find All References | **Shift**+**F12**| Results are colorized and can be grouped by project, definition, and reference type, such as read or write. You can also "lock" results. |
| Go To Implementation | **Ctrl**+**F12** | You can use Go To Definition on the `override` keyword to navigate to the overridden member |
| Go To Definition | **F12** or **Ctrl**+**Click**| Press **Ctrl** while clicking to navigate to definition |
| Peek Definition | **Alt**+**F12** | Inline view of a definition |
| Structure Visualizer | Gray, dotted-lines between braces | Hover to see your code structure |
| Navigation to decompiled assemblies | **F12** or **Ctrl**+**Click** | Navigate to external source (decompiled with ILSpy) by enabling the feature: **Tools** > **Options** > **Text Editor** > **C#** > **Advanced** > **Enable navigation to decompiled sources**. |

![Go To All and Find All References](../ide/media/VSIDE_Productivity_Navigation.png)

## Improved IntelliSense

Use IntelliCode for Visual Studio to get [context-aware code completions](/visualstudio/intellicode/intellicode-visual-studio) instead of just an alphabetical list. You can also train a [custom IntelliSense model](/visualstudio/intellicode/custom-model-faq) based on your own domain-specific libraries.

## Unit testing

Starting in Visual Studio 2017, there are numerous improvements to the testing experience. You can test with the MSTest v1, MSTest v2, NUnit, or XUnit test frameworks.

- **Test Explorer** test discovery is fast.

- Organize your tests in **Test Explorer** with *hierarchical sorting*.

   ![Hierarchy view for Text Explorer in Visual Studio](../ide/media/VSGuide_Testing.png)

- [Live unit testing](../test/live-unit-testing.md) continuously runs tests impacted by your code changes and updates inline editor icons to let you know the status of your tests. Include or exclude specific tests or test projects from your live test set. (Visual Studio Enterprise edition only.)

## Debugging

Some of Visual Studio's debugging capabilities include:

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

- The ability to search for a string within the **Watch**, **Autos**, and **Locals** windows.
- *Run to click*, which lets you hover next to a line of code, hit the green 'play' icon that appears, and run your program until it reaches that line.
- The **Exception Helper**, which puts the most important information at the top level in the dialog, for example, which variable is `null` in a `NullReferenceException`.
- [Step back debugging](../debugger/view-historical-application-state.md), which lets you go back to previous breakpoints or steps and view the state of the application as it was in the past.
- [Snapshot debugging](/azure/application-insights/app-insights-snapshot-debugger), which lets you investigate the state of a live web application at the moment an exception was thrown (must be on Azure).

## Version control

You can use git or TFVC to store and update your code in Visual Studio.

::: moniker range=">=vs-2019"

- Install the [Pull requests for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsideversioncontrolmsft.pr4vs) to create, review, check out, and run pull requests without leaving Visual Studio.

::: moniker-end

- Organize your local changes in [Team Explorer](reference/team-explorer-reference.md) and use the status bar to track pending commits and changes.

- Set up continuous integration and delivery for your ASP.NET projects inside of Visual Studio with the [Continuous delivery tools for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VSIDEDevOpsMSFT.ContinuousDeliveryToolsforVisualStudio) extension.
