# Personalize the Visual Studio IDE

You can personalize Visual Studio in various ways to best support your own development style and requirements. Many of your settings roam with you across Visual Studio instances&mdash;see [Synchronized settings](../ide/synchronized-settings-in-visual-studio.md). This article briefly describes different personalizations and where you can find more information.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to Visual Studio on Windows. For Visual Studio for Mac, see [Customize the Visual Studio for Mac IDE](/visualstudio/mac/customizing-the-ide).

## Default settings

You can choose a default collection of settings that optimizes Visual Studio for your type of development. For more information, see [Environment settings](environment-settings.md).

## General environment options

Many personalization options are exposed through the [Environment Options](../ide/reference/general-environment-options-dialog-box.md) dialog box. There are two ways to access this dialog box:

- On the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options**, and if it's not already expanded, expand the **Environment** node.

- Press **Ctrl**+**Q**, type **environment** in the search box, and then choose **Environment > General** from the results.

> [!TIP]
> When the Options dialog box appears, you can press **F1** for help on the various settings on that page.

## Environment color themes

To change the color theme between Dark, Light, Blue, and Blue (Extra Contrast), type **theme** in the search box, and then choose **Environment > General**. In the **Options** dialog box, change the **Color theme** option.

To change colorization options in the editor, type **environment** in the search box, and then choose **Environment > Fonts and Colors**. See [How to: Change fonts and colors](../ide/how-to-change-fonts-and-colors-in-visual-studio.md).

### Main menu casing

You can change the main menu casing between **Title Case** ("File") and **All Caps** ("FILE"). Type **environment** in the search box, select **Environment > General**, and then change the **Apply title case styling to menu bar** option.

### Customize menus and toolbars

To add or remove menu or toolbar items, see [How to: Customize menus and toolbars](../ide/how-to-customize-menus-and-toolbars-in-visual-studio.md).

## Window layouts

You can define and save multiple window layouts and switch between them. For example, you can define one layout for coding and one for debugging. To arrange window positions and behavior and save custom layouts, see [Customize window layouts](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md).

## External tools

You can customize the **Tools** menu to launch external tools. For more information, see [Manage external tools](../ide/managing-external-tools.md).
