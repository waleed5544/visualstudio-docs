# Refactor code

Refactoring is the process of modifying code in order to make it easier to maintain, understand, and extend, but without changing its behavior.

## Programming languages

Different refactoring operations are available for different programming languages in Visual Studio:

- The pages in this section of the table of contents cover the refactorings available for C# and Visual Basic. Some examples are [Extract a method refactoring](reference/extract-method.md) and [Move type to a matching file refactoring](reference/move-type-to-matching-file.md).
- For information about refactoring C++ code, see [Write and refactor code (C++)](/cpp/ide/writing-and-refactoring-code-cpp).
- Refactoring support for F# is provided by the [Visual F# Power Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FSharpSoftwareFoundation.VisualFPowerTools), a third-party Visual Studio extension.
