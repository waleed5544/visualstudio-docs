# Static helper classes

IntelliTest provides a set of static helper class that can be used when authoring [parameterized unit tests](test-generation.md#parameterized-unit-testing):

* [PexAssume](#pexassume): used to define assumptions on inputs, and is useful for filtering undesirable inputs
* [PexAssert](#pexassert): a simple assertion class for use if your test framework does not provide one
* [PexChoose](#pexchoose): a stream of additional test inputs that IntelliTest manages
* [PexObserve](#pexobserve): logs concrete values and, optionally, validates them in the generated code

Some classes allow you to interact with the IntelliTest reasoning engine at a low-level:

* [PexSymbolicValue](#pexsymbolicvalue): utilities to inspect or modify symbolic constraints on variables

<a name="pexassume"></a>
## PexAssume

A static class used to express assumptions, such as [preconditions](test-generation.md#precondition), in [parameterized unit tests](test-generation.md#parameterized-unit-testing). The methods of this class can be used to filter out undesirable test inputs.

If the assumed condition does not hold for some test input, a **PexAssumeFailedException** is thrown. This will cause the test to be silently ignored.

**Example**

The following parameterized test will not consider **j=0**:

```csharp
public void TestSomething(int i, int j) {
     PexAssume.AreNotEqual(j, 0);
     int k = i/j;
     ...
}
```

**Remarks**

The code above is almost equivalent to:

```csharp
     if (j==0)
          return;
```

except that a failing **PexAssume** results in no test cases. In the case of an **if** statement, IntelliTest generates a separate test case to cover the **then** branch of the **if** statement.

**PexAssume** also contains specialized nested classes for assumptions on string, arrays, and collections.

<a name="pexassert"></a>
## PexAssert

A static class used to express assertions, such as [postconditions](test-generation.md#postcondition), in [parameterized unit tests](test-generation.md#parameterized-unit-testing).

If the asserted condition does not hold for some test input, a **PexAssertFailedException** is thrown, which causes the test to fail.

**Example**

The following asserts that the absolute value of an integer is positive:

```csharp
public void TestSomething(int i) {
     int j = Maths.Abs(i);
     PexAssert.IsTrue(j >= 0);
     ...
}
```

<a name="pexchoose"></a>
## PexChoose

A static class that supplies auxiliary input values
to a test, which can be used to implement
[Parameterized Mocks](input-generation.md#parameterized-mocks).

The **PexChoose** class does not help in determining
whether a test passes or fails for particular input
values. **PexChoose** simply provides input values,
which are also referred to as *choices*. It is still
up to the user to restrict the input values, and to
write assertions that define when a test passes or fails.

**Modes of operation**

The **PexChoose** class can operate in two modes:

* While IntelliTest is performing a symbolic analysis
  of the test and the tested code during
  [input generation](input-generation.md), the chooser
  returns arbitrary values and IntelliTest tracks how
  each value is used in the test and the tested code. IntelliTest will generate relevant values to trigger different execution paths in the test and the tested code.

* The generated code for particular test cases sets
  up the choice provider in a specific way, so that
  the re-execution of such a test case will make
  specific choices to trigger a particular execution path.

**Usage**

* Simple call **PexChoose.Value** to generate a new value:

```csharp
public int Foo() {
    return PexChoose.Value<int>("foo");
}
```

<a name="pexobserve"></a>
## PexObserve

A static class to log named values.

When IntelliTest explores the code, **PexObserve**
is used to record computed values using their
formatted string representations. The values are
associated with unique names.

```csharp
PexObserve.Value<string>("result", result);
```

**Example**

```csharp
// product code
public static class MathEx {
     public static int Square(int value) { return value * value; }
}

// fixture
[TestClass]
public partial class MathExTests {
     [PexMethod]
     public int SquareTest(int a) {
        int result = MathEx.Square(a);
        // storing result
        return result;
     }
}
```

<a name="pexsymbolicvalue"></a>
## PexSymbolicValue

A static class used to ignore constraints on parameters,
and to print the symbolic information associated with values.

**Usage**

Normally, IntelliTest tries to cover all execution
paths of the code during execution. However,
especially when computing assumption and assertion
conditions, it should not explore all possible cases.

**Example**

This example shows the implementation of the
**PexAssume.Arrays.ElementsAreNotNull** method.
In the method, you ignore the constraints on the
lengh of the array value to avoid IntelliTest trying
to generate different sizes of array. The constraints
are ignored only here. If the tested code behaves
differently for different array lengths, IntelliTest
cannot generate different sized arrays from the
constraints of the tested code.

```csharp
public static void AreElementsNotNull<T>(T[] value)
    where T : class
{
    PexAssume.NotNull(value);
    // the followings prevents the exploration of all array lengths
    int len = PexSymbolicValue.Ignore<int>(value.Length);

    // building up a boolean value as follows prevents exploration
    // of all combinations of non-null (instead, there are just two cases)
    bool anyNull = false;
    for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        anyNull |= value[i] == null;

    // was any element null?
    if (anyNull)
        PexAssume.Fail("some element of array is a null reference");
}
```
