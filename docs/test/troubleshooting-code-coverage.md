# Troubleshoot code coverage

The code coverage analysis tool in Visual Studio collects data for native and managed assemblies (*.dll* or *.exe* files). However, in some cases, the **Code Coverage Results** window displays an error similar to "Empty results generated: ...." There are several reasons why you can get empty results. This article helps you resolve those issues.

## What you should see

If you choose an **Analyze Code Coverage** command on the **Test** menu, and if the build and tests run successfully, then you should see a list of results in the **Code Coverage** window. You might have to expand the items to see the detail.

## Possible reasons for seeing no results or old results

### Do you have the right edition of Visual Studio?

You need Visual Studio Enterprise.

### No tests were executed

Analysis&mdash;Check your output window. In the **Show Output from** drop-down list, choose **Tests**. See if there are any warnings or errors logged.

Explanation&mdash;Code coverage analysis is done while tests are running. It only includes assemblies that are loaded into memory when the tests run. If none of the tests are executed, there's nothing for code coverage to report.

Resolution&mdash;In Test Explorer, choose **Run All** to verify that the tests run successfully. Fix any failures before using **Analyze Code Coverage**.

### You're looking at a previous result

When you modify and rerun your tests, a previous code coverage result can still be visible, including the code coloring from that old run.

1. Run **Analyze Code Coverage**.

2. Make sure that you have selected the most recent result set in the **Code Coverage Results** window.

### .pdb (symbol) files are unavailable

Analysis&mdash;Open the compile target folder (typically *bin\debug*), and verify that for each assembly, there's a *.pdb* file in the same directory as the *.dll* or *.exe* file.

Explanation&mdash;The code coverage engine requires that every assembly has its associated *.pdb* file accessible during the test run. If there's no *.pdb* file for a particular assembly, the assembly is not analyzed.

The *.pdb* file must be generated from the same build as the *.dll* or *.exe* files.

Resolution&mdash;Make sure that your build settings generate the *.pdb* file. If the *.pdb* files are not updated when the project is built, then open the project properties, select the **Build** page, choose **Advanced**, and inspect **Debug Info**.

For C++ projects, ensure that the generated .pdb files have full debug information. Open the project properties and verify that **Linker** > **Debugging** > **Generate Debug Info** is set to **Generate Debug Information optimized for sharing and publishing (/DEBUG:FULL)**.

If the *.pdb* and *.dll* or *.exe* files are in different places, copy the *.pdb* file to the same directory. It is also possible to configure code coverage engine to search for *.pdb* files in another location. For more information, see [Customize code coverage analysis](../test/customizing-code-coverage-analysis.md).

### Use an instrumented or optimized binary

Analysis&mdash;Determine if the binary has undergone any form of advanced optimization such as Profile Guided Optimization, or has been instrumented by a profiling tool such as *vsinstr.exe* or *vsperfmon.exe*.

Explanation&mdash;If an assembly has already been instrumented or optimized by another profiling tool, the assembly is omitted from the code coverage analysis. Code coverage analysis can't be performed on such assemblies.

Resolution&mdash;Switch off optimization and use a new build.

### Code is not managed (.NET) or native (C++) code

Analysis&mdash;Verify that you're running some tests on managed or C++ code.

Explanation&mdash;Code coverage analysis in Visual Studio is available only on managed and native (C++) code. If you're working with third-party tools, some or all of the code might execute on a different platform.

Resolution&mdash;None available.

### Assembly has been installed by NGen

Analysis&mdash;Verify that the assembly is not loaded from the native image cache.

Explanation&mdash;For performance reasons, native image assemblies are not analyzed. For more information, see [Ngen.exe (Native Image Generator)](/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator).

Resolution&mdash;Use an MSIL version of the assembly. Don't process it with NGen.

### Custom .runsettings file with bad syntax

Analysis&mdash;If you're using a custom *.runsettings* file, it might contain a syntax error. Code coverage is not run, and either the code coverage window doesn't open at the end of the test run, or it shows old results.

Explanation&mdash;You can run your unit tests with a custom *.runsettings* file to configure code coverage options. The options allow you to include or exclude files. For more information, see [Customize code coverage analysis](../test/customizing-code-coverage-analysis.md).

Resolution&mdash;There are two possible types of faults:

- **XML error**

     Open the *.runsettings* file in the Visual Studio XML editor. Look for error indications.

- **Regular expression error**

  Each string in the file is a regular expression. Review each one for errors, and in particular look for:

  - Mismatched parentheses (...) or unescaped parentheses \\(...\\). If you want to match a parenthesis in the search string, you must escape it. For example, to match a function use: `.*MyFunction\(double\)`

  - Asterisk or plus at the start of an expression. To match any string of characters, use a dot followed by an asterisk: `.*`

### Custom .runsettings file with incorrect exclusions

Analysis&mdash;If you're using a custom *.runsettings* file, make sure that it includes your assembly.

Explanation&mdash;You can run your unit tests with a custom *.runsettings* file to configure code coverage options. The options allow you to include or exclude files. For more information, see [Customize code coverage analysis](../test/customizing-code-coverage-analysis.md).

Resolution&mdash;Remove all the `Include` nodes from the *.runsettings* file, and then remove all the `Exclude` nodes. If that fixes the problem, put them back in stages.

Make sure the DataCollectors node specifies Code Coverage. Compare it with the sample in [Customize code coverage analysis](../test/customizing-code-coverage-analysis.md).

## Some code is always shown as not covered

### Initialization code in native DLLs is executed before instrumentation

Analysis&mdash;In statically linked native code, part of the initialization function **DllMain** and code that it calls is sometimes shown as not covered, even though the code has been executed.

Explanation&mdash;The code coverage tool works by inserting instrumentation into an assembly just before the application starts running. In any assembly loaded beforehand, the initialization code in **DllMain** executes as soon as the assembly loads, and before the application runs. That code appears to be not covered, which typically applies to statically loaded assemblies.

Resolution&mdash;None.
