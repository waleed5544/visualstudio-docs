The tables on this page list the IDs that you can use to install Visual Studio from the command line, or that you can specify as a dependency in a VSIX manifest. We'll add additional components when we release updates to Visual Studio.

Also note the following about the page:

* Each workload has its own section, followed by the workload ID and a table of the components that are available for the workload.
* By default, the **Required** components will be installed when you install the workload.
* If you choose to, you can also install the **Recommended** and **Optional** components.
* We've also added a section that lists the additional components that are not affiliated with any workload.
