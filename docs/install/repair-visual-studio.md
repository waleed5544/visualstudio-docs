# Repair Visual Studio

Sometimes your Visual Studio installation becomes damaged or corrupted. A repair is useful for fixing a wide variety of install-time issues, including update issues.

## When to use repair

Use repair if you're having issues with:

* Installation payload, which can happen when writing a file to disk is unsuccessful and the file gets corrupted. Repair can reacquire needed files.
* Client-side downloadâ€”assuming you've fixed any internet connection or proxy issues.
* Updating Visual Studio. Repair fixes many common update issues.

> [!TIP] 
> An unstable internet connection or an issue in a Windows service, like Windows Installer, can cause install issues. In those scenarios, repair might also be affected. To check for underlying issues, review the error report generated by the Visual Studio Installer.

> [!NOTE] 
> Repairing Visual Studio resets user settings and reinstalls your existing assemblies. If you're experiencing a product issue and repair does not fix it, create a [Visual Studio Feedback Ticket](https://aka.ms/feedback/suggest?space=8). For more information, see [How to report a problem with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Installer](../ide/how-to-report-a-problem-with-visual-studio.md).

## How to repair
::: moniker range="vs-2017"

1. Find the **Visual Studio Installer** on your computer.

     For example, on a computer running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later, select **Start**, and then scroll to the letter **V**, where it's listed as **Visual Studio Installer**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > On some computers, the Visual Studio Installer might be listed under the letter **"M"** as the **Microsoft Visual Studio Installer**.
   >
   > Alternatively, you can find the Visual Studio Installer in the following location:
   >`C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vs_installer.exe`

1. Open the installer, choose **More**, and then choose **Repair**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Repairing Visual Studio will reset the environment. Local customizations like per-user extensions installed without elevation, user settings, and profiles will be removed. Your synchronized settings such as themes, colors, key bindings will be restored.
   >

   > [!TIP]
   > The **Repair** option appears only for installed instances of Visual Studio. If you do not see the **Repair** option, chances are that you've selected **More** in a version that's listed in the Visual Studio Installer as "Available" rather than "Installed".
