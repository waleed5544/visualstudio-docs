# CA0057

Violations cannot be mapped to the current set of targets and rules

This error occurs if FxCopCmd.exe is invoked manually with a project file or an /imported XML report that has violations that cannot be mapped to the current set of targets and rules.

Occurs only if analysis is done using the command-line version of the tool.
