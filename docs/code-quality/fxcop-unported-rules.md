# Unported rules

## Overview

The set of FxCop legacy analysis rules that haven't been implemented as Roslyn analyzers consists of the following two buckets:
- Rules that haven't yet been ported, but still [may be ported](fxcop-unported-rules-may-get-ported.md).
- Rules that are deprecated and [won't be ported](fxcop-unported-deprecated-rules.md).
