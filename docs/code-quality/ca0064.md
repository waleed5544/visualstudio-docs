# CA0064

No analysis was performed because the specified rule set did not contain any FxCop rules.

This warning can occur in one of the following situations:

- If you encounter this warning in conjunction with CA0063 warnings, there was a problem loading your rule set file. For more information, see the [CA0063](ca0063.md) article.

- If you encounter this error in conjunction with CA0062 warnings, it most likely that code analysis was unable to find the assembly or assemblies that contain the rules specified by the rule set. For more information, see the [CA0062](ca0062.md) article.

- Otherwise, this warning usually occurs when your rule set is empty or all of the rules enabled in a child rule set are disabled. Use the Visual Studio [rule set editor](../code-quality/working-in-the-code-analysis-rule-set-editor.md) to enable some rules in your rule set.
