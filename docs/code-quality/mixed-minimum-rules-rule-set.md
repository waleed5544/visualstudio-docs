# Mixed Minimum Rules rule set

The Microsoft Mixed Minimum Rules focus on the most critical problems in C++ projects that support the Common Language Runtime, including potential security holes and application crashes.

Include this rule set in any custom rule set you create for your C++ projects that support the Common Language Runtime.
