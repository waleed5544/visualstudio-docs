# Mixed Recommended Rules rule set

The Microsoft Mixed Recommended Rules focus on the most common and critical problems in your C++ projects that support the Common Language Runtime, including potential security holes, application crashes, and other important logic and design errors. This rule set includes all of the rules in the [Mixed Minimum Rules](mixed-minimum-rules-rule-set.md) rule set.

Include this rule set in any custom rule set you create for your C++ projects that support the Common Language Runtime.
