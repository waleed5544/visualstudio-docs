# Help Viewer administrator guide

The Help Viewer allows you to manage local Help installations for network environments with or without internet access. Local help content is configured on a per machine basis. By default, users must have administrator rights to update their local Help installation.

If your network environment allows clients to access the internet, you can use the **Help Content Manager** executable to deploy local Help content from the internet. For more information about *HlpCtntMgr.exe* command line syntax, see [Command-line arguments for the Help Content Manager](../help-viewer/command-line-arguments.md).

For information about creating content, creating an intranet service endpoint, and similar types of activities, see the [Help Viewer SDK](../extensibility/internals/microsoft-help-viewer-sdk.md).

If you do not have internet access in your network environment, Help Viewer can deploy local Help content from the intranet or a network share. You can also disable Visual Studio IDE Help options by using [registry key overrides](../help-viewer/behavior-overrides.md) for functionality such as:

- online versus offline help

- content installation at first launch of the IDE

- specifying an intranet content service

- managing content

## Deploy local Help content from the internet

You can use **Help Content Manager** (*HlpCtntMgr.exe*) to deploy local Help content from the internet to client computers. Use the following syntax:

```cmd
\\%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Help Viewer\v2.3\HlpCtntmgr.exe /operation \<*name*> /catalogname \<*catalog name*> /locale \<*locale*>
```

For more information about *HlpCtntMgr.exe* command line syntax, see [Command-line arguments for the Help Content Manager](../help-viewer/command-line-arguments.md).

Requirements:

- Client computers must have access to the internet.

- Users must have administrator rights to update, add, or remove the local Help content after it has been installed.

Caveats:

- The default source for Help will still be online.

### Example

The following example installs English content for Visual Studio to a client computer.

#### To install English content from the internet

1. Choose **Start** and then choose **Run**.

2. Type the following:

     `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Help Viewer\v2.3\hlpctntmgr.exe /operation install /catalogname VisualStudio15 /locale en-us`

3. Press **Enter**.

## Deploy pre-installed local Help content on client computers

You can install a set of content from online to one computer, and then copy that installed set of content to other computers.

Requirements:

- The computer you install the set of content to must have access to the internet.

- Users must have administrator rights to update, add, or remove the local Help content after it has been installed.

    > [!TIP]
    > If users do not have administrator rights, it is recommended that you disable the **Manage Content** tab in the Help Viewer. For more information, see [Help Content Manager overrides](../help-viewer/behavior-overrides.md).

Caveats:

- The default source for Help will still be online.

### Create the content set

Before you can create the base content set, you must first uninstall all local Visual Studio content on the target computer.

#### To uninstall local help

1. In the Help Viewer, choose the **Manage Content** tab.

2. Navigate to the Visual Studio document set.

3. Choose **Remove** next to each sub-item.

4. Choose **Update** to uninstall.

5. Browse to *%ProgramData%\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2\Catalogs\VisualStudio15* and verify that the folder only contains the file *catalogType.xml*.

   Once you have removed all previously installed local Visual Studio Help content, you are ready to download the base content set.

#### To download the content

1. In the Help Viewer, choose the **Manage Content** tab.

2. Under **Recommended Documentation** or **Available Documentation**, navigate to the documentation sets you want to download and then choose **Add**.

3. Choose **Update**.

Next, you need to package the content so it can be deployed to client computers.

#### To package the content

1. Create a folder to copy the content to for later deployment. For example: *C:\VSHelp*.

2. Open *cmd.exe* with Administrator permissions.

3. Navigate to the folder you created in step 1.

4. Type the following:

     `Xcopy %ProgramData%\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2 \<*foldername*>\ /y /e /k /o`

     For example: `Xcopy %ProgramData%\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2 c:\VSHelp\ /y /e /k /o`

### Deploy the content

1. Create a network share and copy the help content to that location.

     For example, copy the content in *C:\VSHelp* to *\\\myserver\VSHelp*.

2. Create a *.bat* file to contain the deployment script for the help content. Since the client could possibly have a read lock on any of the files being deleted as part of the push, you should have the client shut down prior to pushing updates. For example:

    ```cmd
    REM - copy pre-ripped content to ProgramData
    Xcopy %~dp0HelpLibrary2 %SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Microsoft\HelpLibrary2\ /y /e /k /o
    if ERRORLEVEL 1 ECHO *** ERROR COPYING Help Library files to ProgramData (%ERRORLEVEL%)
    ```

3. Run the *.bat* file on the local machines that you want to install the Help content on.
