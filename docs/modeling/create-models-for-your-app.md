# Create models for your app

Modeling diagrams help you understand, clarify, and communicate ideas about your code and the user requirements that your software system must support.

To see which versions of Visual Studio support each type of diagram, see [Version support for architecture and modeling tools](../modeling/analyze-and-model-your-architecture.md#VersionSupport).

To visualize the architecture of a system or existing code, create the following diagrams:

|**Diagram**|**Shows**|
|-|-|
|[Dependency Diagrams: Guidelines](../modeling/layer-diagrams-guidelines.md)<br /><br /> [Dependency Diagrams: Reference](../modeling/layer-diagrams-reference.md)|High-level architecture of the system|
|Code maps<br /><br /> [Map dependencies across your solutions](../modeling/map-dependencies-across-your-solutions.md)<br /><br /> [Find potential problems using code map analyzers](../modeling/find-potential-problems-using-code-map-analyzers.md)|Dependencies and other relationships in existing code|
|Code-generated class diagrams<br /><br /> [Working with Class Diagrams (Class Designer)](../ide/class-designer/designing-and-viewing-classes-and-types.md)|Types and their relationships in .NET code|
