# Use escape sequences in text templates

You can use escape sequences in text templates to generate text template tags and (in C# code only) to escape control characters and quotation marks.

To print open and close tags for a standard code block to the output file, escape the tags as follows:

```
\<# ... \#>
```

You can do the same with other text template directive and code block tags.

If a text block includes strings used to escape text template tags, then you may use the following escape sequences:

- If a text template tag is preceded by an even number of escape (\\) characters the template parser will include half of the escape characters and include the sequence as a text template tag. For example, if there are four escape characters in the text template, there will be two "\\" characters in the generated file.

- If the text template tag is preceded by an odd number of escape (\\) characters, the template parser will include half of the "\\" characters plus the tag itself (\<# or #>). The tag is not considered to be a text template tag.

- If an escape (\\) character appears anywhere else in any sequence other than where it escapes a control character or a quote (in C# only), the character will be output directly.
