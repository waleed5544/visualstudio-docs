# Performance Explorer

The Visual Studio Profiling Tools let developers measure, evaluate, and target performance-related issues in their code. These tools are fully integrated into the IDE to provide a seamless and approachable user experience.

Profiling an application is straightforward. You begin by creating a new performance session. In Visual Studio Team System Development Edition, you can use the Performance Session Wizard to create a new performance session. After a performance session ends, data gathered during profiling is saved in a .*vsp* file. You can view the .*vsp* file inside the IDE. There are several report views available to help visualize and detect performance issues from the data gathered.

Profiling Tools can also be used from the command line. This allows users the flexibility of running these tools from the command line or using them to automate tasks that use script.

For more information about current and advanced topics related to performance and profiling, search the Microsoft Developer Network for topics and Microsoft blogs. Use the keywords Enterprise Performance Tools Team.
