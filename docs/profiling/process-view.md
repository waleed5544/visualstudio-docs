# Process View
The Process view displays profiling data for the processes and threads that were executed during the profiling run.

 Processes are listed by name. Threads are listed as child nodes of the process that created them. Threads are named by the function that started the thread or by the label **[ntdll.dll]** if no symbols are available.

 To add or remove columns, right-click in the view, and then select **Add/Remove Columns**. Additionally, you can sort the data by clicking a column name. For more information, see [How to: Customize report view columns](../profiling/how-to-customize-report-view-columns.md).

 The columns of the Process view are the same for data that is generated by using the sampling and instrumentation methods and for data that includes .NET memory data. The following table describes the column values.

|Column|Description|
|------------|-----------------|
|**Unique ID**|A profiler-generated identifier that is unique to the process or thread.|
|**ID**|A system-generated identifier of the process or thread.|
|**Name**|The name of the process or thread.|
|**Begin Time**|The number of milliseconds or processor cycles from the start of profiling to the start of the process or thread.|
|**End Time**|The number of milliseconds or processor cycles from the start of profiling to the end of the process or thread.|
