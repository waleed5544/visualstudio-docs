# Functions View
The Functions view lists the functions that are called during profiling.

 By default, functions are listed by name. To view functions by module, right-click in the Functions View window and then select **Show in Module View**. This will display the Module view.

 To add or remove columns, right-click in the report window and then select **Add/Remove Columns**. Additionally, you can sort the data by clicking a column name. For more information, see [How to: Customize Report View columns](../profiling/how-to-customize-report-view-columns.md).

 The columns that are available in the Functions view depend on the profiling method (sampling or instrumentation) that was used to collect the data, and whether .NET memory data was collected in the profiling run.
