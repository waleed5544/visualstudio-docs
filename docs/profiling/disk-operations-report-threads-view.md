The Disk Operations Report shows disk I/O operations in the disk channels.

 For each disk access that occurs on behalf of the process that's being profiled in the currently visible time window, this information is reported:

- The name and PID of the process that performed the disk access

- The ID of the thread that accessed the disk

- The name of the file that was accessed

- The number of reads per file

- The number of bytes read

- The read latency, in milliseconds

- The number of writes

- The number of bytes written

- The write latency, in milliseconds
