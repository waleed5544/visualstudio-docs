# Getting started with performance tools

Visual Studio offers several ways to collect, view, and analyze code performance data. In many cases, the best way to get started with performance tools is to use the default settings of the **Performance Wizard**. The wizard collects app statistics that can point to performance issues in your code.

- Performance warnings that notify you of common coding issues appear in the Visual Studio **Error List** window. You can navigate from the warnings to your source code, and to detailed help topics that help you write more efficient code.

- Performance reports provide views on different levels of your application structure, source code lines, and processes. Performance reports show app execution data, from the calling and called functions of a specific function to the call tree of the entire app.

To quickly profile a project, app, or ASP.NET website, select **Debug** > **Performance Profiler**, and select **Performance Wizard**. For detailed instructions, see [Beginners guide to performance profiling](../profiling/beginners-guide-to-cpu-sampling.md) and [How to: Collect performance data for a website](../profiling/how-to-collect-performance-data-for-a-web-site.md).

To manually specify and configure a performance profiling session, select **Debug** > **Profiler** > **Performance Explorer**. Use the **Targets** folder and **Properties** pages in **Performance Explorer** to configure sessions. For instructions, see [How to: Manually create performance sessions](../profiling/how-to-manually-create-performance-sessions.md).
