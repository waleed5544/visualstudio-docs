# TargetCLR
The **TargetCLR** option specifies the version of the common language run-time (CLR) to profile when more than one version of the CLR is loaded in an application.

 By default, the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools target the first version of the CLR that is loaded by the application.

## Syntax

```cmd
VSPerfCmd.exe {/Launch:AppName | /Attach:PID} /TargetCLR[:ClrVersion] [Options]
```

#### Parameters
 `ClrVersion`
 The version number of the CLR. Use the version format **vN.N.NNNNN**.

## Required options
 The **TargetCLR** option can only be used with the **Launch** or **Attach** options.

 **Launch:** `AppName`
 Starts the specified application and starts to profile.

 **Attach:** `PID`
 Starts to profile the specified process.

## Example
 In this example, the TargetCLR option is used to make sure that CLR version 4.0.11003 is profiled.

```cmd
VSPerfCmd.exe /Start:Sample /Output:TestApp.exe.vsp
VSPerfCmd.exe /Launch:TestApp.exe /TargetCLR:v4.0.11003
```
