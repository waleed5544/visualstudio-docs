# Resource Contention Data Views
This section contains reference information for the views and reports of profiler data files that contain thread contention profiling data.

## In This Section
- [Summary View - Profiler Contention Data](../profiling/resource-contention-data-views.md)

 Displays a graphical timeline of the profiling data and lists the functions and resources that participated in the most blocking events.

- [Call Tree View](../profiling/call-tree-view-contention-data.md)

 Displays a hierarchical tree that represents the execution paths and resource contention data of functions in the profiling run.

- [Modules View](../profiling/modules-view-contention-data.md)

 Organizes thread and resource contention data by module and lists the functions, source code lines, and instructions that were executing when blocking events occurred.

- [Caller / Callee View -  Contention Data](../profiling/caller-callee-view-contention-data.md)

 Lists thread and resource contention data for a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.

- [Resource Details View](../profiling/resource-details-view-contention-data.md)

 Displays a graphical timeline of the blocking events for each contended resource and lists the call stack for the blocking events.

- [Thread Details View](../profiling/thread-details-view-contention-data.md)

 Displays a graphical timeline of the blocking events for each thread and lists the call stack for the blocking events.

- [Functions View](../profiling/functions-view-contention-data.md)

 Lists thread and resource contention data by function.

- [Resource Contentions View](../profiling/resource-contentions-view-contention-data.md)

 Lists resource contention data by blocked resource.

- [Lines View](../profiling/lines-view-contention-data.md)

 Lists resource contention data by source code line.

- [Instruction Pointers (IPs) View](../profiling/instruction-pointers-ips-view-contention-data.md)

 Lists resource contention by instruction.

- [Process View](../profiling/process-view-contention-data.md)

 Lists resource contention by process and thread.

## Reference
- [Function Details View](../profiling/function-details-view.md)

 Displays a graphical chart of the relationship between a selected function and the functions that called and were called by the selected function.
