# Profile ASP.NET load tests
You can collect profiling data from automated [!INCLUDE[TCMext](../misc/includes/tcmext_md.md)] web tests that you run on ASP.NET Web sites projects. You can collect sampling and tier interaction data. For more information, see the following topics:

- [(NIB) How to: Run a Performance Session on a Web Application from the Web Performance Test Editor](/previous-versions/ff356203(v=vs.100))

- [How to: Configure ASP.NET Profiler for Load Tests Using Test Settings in Visual Studio](/previous-versions/dd504817(v=vs.140))
