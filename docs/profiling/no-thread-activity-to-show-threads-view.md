# No thread activity to show (Threads View)
This area shows data about the unhidden threads in the currently visible time range.

 If no information is visible, check the following settings:

- Is the zoom level high? Try zooming out or scrolling to bring more thread activity in range.

- Are too many threads hidden? If so, try showing all threads

- If **Just My Code** is selected, you can only view data about your code. Try clearing the setting to ascertain whether there is any system thread activity.

- Make sure that Noise Reduction is set to a low threshold.
