# Overviews (performance tools)
This section provides conceptual and terminology overviews for [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools, which you can use to measure the performance characteristics of an application under development.

## In this section
- [Performance session overview](../profiling/performance-session-overview.md)

 Learn the basics of performance profiling with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] Profiling Tools.

- [Performance session properties](../profiling/performance-session-properties.md)

 Describes the properties that can be used to configure a performance session.

- [Understand sampling data values](../profiling/understanding-sampling-data-values.md)

 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the sampling profiling method.

- [Understand instrumentation data values](../profiling/understanding-instrumentation-data-values.md)

 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the instrumentation profiling method.

- [Understand memory allocation and object lifetime data values](../profiling/understanding-memory-allocation-and-object-lifetime-data-values.md)

 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the .NET memory profiling method.

- [Understand resource contention data values](../profiling/understanding-resource-contention-data-values.md)

 Learn the data values that are reported when you use the concurrency profiling method.

- [Performance Explorer window](../profiling/performance-explorer-window.md)

 Describes the window that is used to configure and start performance sessions.

- [CPU and Windows counters](../profiling/cpu-and-windows-counters.md)

 Learn about the CPU and Windows performance counters that can provide additional performance data in a performance session.

- [Profiling and Windows Vista security](../profiling/profiling-and-windows-vista-security.md)

 Learn the issues and steps that are required to collect sampling data and to profile cross-session applications on [!INCLUDE[wiprlhext](../debugger/includes/wiprlhext_md.md)].
