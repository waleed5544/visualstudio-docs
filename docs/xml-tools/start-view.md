# Start View

The Start View is the launching point for the XML Schema (XSD) Designer. When you create a new XSD file, you will initially see the Start View.

The Start View contains two main sections, the *watermark* and the **Schema Set Details** pane. It also includes the toolbar, which is available in all the XSD Designer views.

## Watermark

The watermark pane contains a list of links to all the XSD Designer views, XML editor, and **XML Schema Explorer**. If the schema set has errors, the following text is displayed at the end of the list: "Use the Error List to view and fix the errors in the set."

## Schema set details

The **Schema Set Details** pane lists the global schema node types, and displays how many instances of each type there are in the schema. You can use the **add** links next to the node types to add new nodes to the workspace.

## Toolbar

You can navigate between the Start View, the [Content Model View](../xml-tools/content-model-view.md) and the [Graph View](../xml-tools/graph-view.md) from the XML Schema Designer toolbar.
