# Sorting, filtering, and grouping (XML Schema Explorer)

This topic describes the options that are available through the **Sorting, Filtering, and Grouping Options** menu on the **XML Schema Explorer** toolbar.

## Filter options

The following filter options are available. By default, the **Show Namespaces** and **Show Schema Files** options are selected.

- **Show Namespaces**.

- **Show Schema Files**.

- **Show Compositors (sequence/choice/all)**.

## Sorting options

The following sorting options are available. The default is **Sort By Type**. **Sort By** options do not apply to files and namespaces.

- **Sort By Type**.

- **Sort By Name**.

- **Document Order**.

### Sort By Type

When the **Sort By Type** option is selected, global nodes are sorted in the following order. Nodes are then sorted alphabetically within each group.

1. `import` nodes.

2. `include` nodes.

3. `redefine` nodes.

4. `attribute` nodes.

5. `attributeGroup` nodes.

6. `complexType` nodes.

7. `simpleType` nodes.

8. `element` nodes.

9. `group` nodes.

### Sort By Name

When the **Sort By Name** option is selected, global nodes are sorted in the following order:

1. `import` nodes (in alphabetical order of namespaces).

2. `include` nodes (in alphabetical order of `schemaLocation` attributes).

3. `redefine` nodes (in alphabetical order of `schemaLocation` attributes).

4. Other global nodes in alphabetical order.

### Document Order

The **Document Order** option is available when the **Show Schema Files** option is selected. When **Document Order** is selected, global nodes are displayed in the order in which they appear in the schema file.

## Persisting sort/filter options

The sorting, filtering, and grouping options are saved to the registry for each user, no matter which solution or files were open when the settings were changed.
