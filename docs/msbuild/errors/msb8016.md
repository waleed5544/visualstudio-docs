# MSBuild error MSB8016

> MSB8016: This project does not support the current Configuration Type (*configuration-type*).

This error occurs when the project configuration is incorrect for a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) or Windows Store app (a WindowsAppContainer app). To fix this issue, modify your project configuration to set the project configuration type as an application, dynamic library, or static library.
