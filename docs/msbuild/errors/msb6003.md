# MSB6003: The specified task executable "executable" could not be run

This error indicates that an executable that was part of the build process could not be executed. There is usually an additional error text that might give more information on the cause of the problem.

If you need more information to diagnose the error, first enable a diagnostic log (use the `-verbosity:diag` command-line switch), and check the MSBuild log file with the full diagnostics output. For bigger output logs on large projects, consider using the binary log (`-bl` command-line switch) and the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to view the output more easily.

If the task ran an executable, try running the executable separately with the same inputs and command line.

Examples of situations that cause this error:

## File or folder not found

If the executable could not be found, or the path was incorrect, verify the spelling and check the installation location of the executable to verify it is correctly installed.

## File is in use

If another program is running on the same machine that has a lock on a file that is needed for a build, it could cause this error. Shut down any other processes that might be using the same files.

## Too many temporary files

If you're running MSBuild on a build server and temporary files are never removed, you might eventually reach the maximum number of files allowed in a folder. The limit is specific to the filesystem. For FAT32 filesystem, it's 65534. For NTFS, it's 4,294,967,295. Upgrading from FAT32 to NTFS might help prevent this issue. On a Windows system, the temporary files folder is stored in the TMP or TEMP environment variable. On a Mac or Linux system, the environment variable TMPDIR tells where temporary files are stored. Check the temp folder and empty it, as needed. Also, consider adding a scheduled job to clean the temp folder, or steps to your build process to remove temp files that were created during a build.

The maximum number of files can also be exceeded on another folder. Also, check for any tools in your build system that could be generating extremely large numbers of files.

## Path too long

If the issue is too long a path on Windows, rather than working around to create shorter paths, first consider updating a registry setting to enable long paths; see [Maximum Path Length Limitation](/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).
