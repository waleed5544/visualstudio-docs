# MSB6011: Invalid parameters passed to the 'task-name' task

This error occurs when a task indicates that the parameters passed to it are not valid. Normally, a task generates a customized error message in that case, by specifying such in the implementation of the `ValidateParameters` method. If the task doesn't override that method, the base ToolTask version of that method is used, which generates this error.

If the task is provided by a vendor, consider contacting the vendor and asking them to implement the `ValidateParameters` method on the task. If this is your own custom task, consider implementing that method to provide a detailed message that indicates what parameter was invalid and why.
