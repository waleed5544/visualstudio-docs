# MSB3554: Cannot write to the output file 'filename'

This error occurs when MSBuild encounters a problem when trying to write to a specific output file. When you see this error, the error text from the operating system is also shown just after it. Look to the specific error text for additional information about the problem.

A common cause is that the output file is in use by another process. Close other applications that might be using the same file, and try building again.
