# MSBuild error MSB8006

> The Platform for project '*project-name.vcxproj*' is invalid.  Platform='*platform-name*'. This error may also appear if some other project is trying to follow a project-to-project reference to this project, this project has been unloaded or is not included in the solution, and the referencing project does not build using the same or an equivalent Platform.

A *Platform* is a build target architecture that uses a matching set of C++ build tools and libraries, or *toolset*. Visual Studio supplies specific platform toolsets to build for Win32 (x86), x64, ARM, and ARM64 Windows targets. It also supports optional platform toolsets to build for Linux, Android, and iOS targets.

There are several ways to resolve this issue:

- This error can occur when your project has specified a platform, but it's not one that Visual Studio has installed. You can use the Visual Studio Installer to install optional platforms and toolsets. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific platforms, libraries, and SDKs.

- You've specified a custom platform, but Visual Studio can't find it. Most projects don't need to specify a custom platform, but it's possible to create one. For more information, see [Visual Studio C++ Project system extensibility and toolset integration](../../extensibility/visual-cpp-project-extensibility.md). Once you've created the custom *`.props`* and *`.targets`* files for your platform, you can select it in the IDE in the Property Pages dialog for your project. 

- Make sure that the project is loaded when built by a referencing project. Verify that it's built for the same platform as the referencing project.
