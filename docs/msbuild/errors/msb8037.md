# MSBuild error MSB8037

> The Windows SDK version *sdk-version* for Desktop C++ *platform* Apps was not found. Install the required version of Windows SDK or change the SDK version in the project property pages or by right-clicking the solution and selecting "Retarget solution".

Your project specified a Windows SDK that isn't installed or can't be found.

There are several ways to resolve this issue:

- This error can occur when your project specifies a Windows SDK that isn't installed. You can use the Visual Studio Installer to install specific versions of the Windows SDK. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific Windows SDKs.

- The error can occur if you've ported a project, but haven't updated the target Windows SDK. To specify the target SDK, right-click on your solution (not your project) in **Solution Explorer**. Select **Retarget solution** in the shortcut menu. In the **Review Solution Actions** dialog, use the **Windows SDK Version** drop-down control to select a specific Windows SDK. You can select **10.0 (latest installed version)** to always use the most recent SDK version.

- To specify a target Windows SDK for your project, you can use the project Property Pages dialog. Select your project (not the solution) in **Solution Explorer**. Right-click the project and select **Properties** in the shortcut menu. In the **Property Pages** dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **General**. Modify the **Windows SDK Version** or **Target Platform Version**. You can select **10.0 (latest installed version)** to always use the most recent SDK version.

- The error can occur if you've set the wrong SDK path, or copied a project from another computer that used custom SDK paths. To verify the SDK path isn't set to the wrong location, select your project in **Solution Explorer**. Right-click the project and select **Properties** in the shortcut menu. In the **Property Pages** dialog, select **Configuration Properties** > **VC++ Directories**. Check the **Include Directories** and **Library Directories** for custom paths, and correct them, if needed. The default Include directory for your selected Windows SDK is specified by the `$(WindowsSDK_IncludePath)` macro. The default Library directory is specified by the `$(WindowsSDK_LibraryPath_<platform>)` macro, where `<platform>` represents the target architecture.
