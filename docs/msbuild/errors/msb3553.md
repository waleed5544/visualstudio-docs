# Resource file 'name' has an invalid name

This error occurs when there's a problem with the name of a resource file. Check that the file has an extension appropriate to its type (for example, .resx), and that it doesn't contain any characters that are not allowed by the operating system. Refer to your operating system documentation for characters that are invalid in a filename or path. For Windows, see [Naming a file](/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#naming-conventions).

This error could also occur if paths exceed the maximum path length. If you use long paths, check the Windows operating system LongPathsEnabled setting. See [Maximum file path limitation](/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=cmd).
