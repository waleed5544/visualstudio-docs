# MSB3304: Could not determine the dependencies of the COM reference 'reference'

This error is shown whenever there's an error that occurs when MSBuild scans a COM reference to attempt to resolve dependencies. There's another error shown that provides more information on the failure.

If the subsequent error message is from the type library importer, you can also try running *tlbimp.exe* directly to get a more detailed error message. See [TlbImp.exe (Type Library Importer)](/dotnet/framework/tools/tlbimp-exe-type-library-importer).

For more information, see [How to: Add references to type libraries](/dotnet/framework/interop/how-to-add-references-to-type-libraries).
