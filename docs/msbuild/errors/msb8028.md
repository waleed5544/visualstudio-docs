# MSBuild warning MSB8028

> MSB8028: The intermediate directory (*shared-intermediate-path*) contains files shared from another project (*intermediate-path*). This can lead to incorrect clean and rebuild behavior.

Two or more projects produce outputs to the same location. This issue can lead to an incorrect build result. The intermediate directories involved are *shared-intermediate-path* and *intermediate-path*.

To resolve this issue:

- For each project in your solution, set your `$(IntDir)` property for each supported configuration and platform to use its own unique directory. To set the intermediate file location, select the project in Solution Explorer, then right-click to open the shortcut menu. Choose **Properties** to open the **Property Pages** dialog for the project. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Output Files** property page. For each configuration in the project, set the **Intermediate Directory** property.
