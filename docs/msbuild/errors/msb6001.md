# MSB6001: Invalid command line switch for 'tool'

This error occurs when an MSBuild task was given a command-line option that was not valid. Look to the second error for more details on the problem.

Common causes are:

- Illegal characters in a path. Check the placement of quotes to ensure they're not used inappropriately.
- A spelling error in the syntax of the switch
- The version of the tool you're using doesn't support that switch
