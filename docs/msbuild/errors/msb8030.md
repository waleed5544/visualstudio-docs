# MSBuild warning MSB8030

> MSB8030: The linker switch "Minimum Required Version" requires "SubSystem" to be set.  Without "SubSystem", the "Minimum Required Version" would not be passed to linker and could prevent to the output binary from running on older Operating Systems.

To resolve this issue:

- Set the [`/SUBSYSTEM`](/cpp/build/reference/subsystem-specify-subsystem) property for your project. To set this value in your project properties, select the project in Solution Explorer, then right-click to open the shortcut menu. Choose **Properties** to open the **Property Pages** dialog for the project. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **Linker** > **System** property page. For each configuration in the project, set the **SubSystem** property.
