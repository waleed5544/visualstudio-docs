# MSBuild error MSB8011

> MSB8011: Failed to register output. Please try enabling Per-user Redirection or register the component from a command prompt with elevated permissions.

This error occurs when an attempt to register a component fails. A registration failure can occur for several reasons. 

- Different permissions may be required for per-user or global registration. The IDE, developer command prompt, or *`regsvr32.exe`* process may need to run with elevated permissions (Run as Administrator). 

- Component registration may fail because required DLL dependencies couldn't be found. You may need to place dependencies in the same directory as the component to register.

- Component registration may fail because required DLL dependencies don't match the target architecture of the component. Make sure to use dependencies built for the same architecture as your component.

- Component registration may fail if your component requires but doesn't define a `DllInstall` entry point.
