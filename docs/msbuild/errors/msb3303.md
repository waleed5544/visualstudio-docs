# MSB3303: Could not resolve COM reference 'reference' version 'version'

This error occurs when MSBuild failed to generate a .NET assembly (Primary Interop Assembly or PIA) for the COM reference. Look to the more detailed message for more information about the possible cause and how to resolve it.

If the subsequent error message is from the type library importer, you can also try running *tlbimp.exe* directly to get a more detailed error message. See [TlbImp.exe (Type Library Importer)](/dotnet/framework/tools/tlbimp-exe-type-library-importer).

For more information, see [How to: Add references to type libraries](/dotnet/framework/interop/how-to-add-references-to-type-libraries).
