# MSBuild error MSB8020

> MSB8020: The build tools for *toolset-name* (Platform Toolset = '*platform-toolset*') cannot be found. To build using the *platform-toolset* build tools, please install *toolset-name* build tools.  Alternatively, you may upgrade to the current Visual Studio tools by selecting the Project menu or right-click the solution, and then selecting "Retarget solution".

To resolve this issue, upgrade the project to use the current Visual Studio toolset, or use the Visual Studio Installer to install the specified build toolset. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific platform toolsets.
