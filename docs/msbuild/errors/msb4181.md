# MSB4181: The 'task' task returned false but did not log an error

This error occurs when a task returned `false` to signal that it did not complete successfully, but did not log an error. This indicates a failure from a task that did not report enough information about the problem.  

To diagnose the error, first enable a diagnostic log (use the `-verbosity:diag` command-line switch), and check the MSBuild log file with the full diagnostics output. For bigger output logs on large projects, consider using the binary log (`-bl` command-line switch) and the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](https://msbuildlog.com/) to view the output more easily.

If the task ran an executable, try running the executable separately with the same inputs and command line.

If you know the owner of the task, consider reporting this issue to them and recommending that they modify the task to log more information.

If it's a custom task and you are the task owner, consider improving the error logging.
