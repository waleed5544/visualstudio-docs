# MSB3027: Could not copy 'source' to 'dest'. Exceeded retry count of 'number'. Failed

This error occurs when MSBuild tries to copy a file repeatedly and fails when the limit of the number of retries is reached. Look to the additional error text for any error from the operating system that indicates what the problem might be.

Typical causes include the destination file is in use by another program, the permissions to not allow writing to the destination file, not enough space on the drive, or the network drive is not available due to a network or permissions error.
