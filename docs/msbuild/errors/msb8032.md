# MSBuild error MSB8032

> MSB8032: The Platform or PlatformToolset is not available from a 64bit environment.  Consider building from 32bit environment instead.

To resolve this issue, modify the project to use the 32-bit toolset for the build configuration. For more information, see [General Property Page (Project)](/cpp/build/reference/general-property-page-project).
