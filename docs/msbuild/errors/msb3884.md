# MSB3884: Could not find rule set file 'filename'

This error occurs when MSBuild couldn't find a ruleset file needed by Code Analysis. Code Analysis uses ruleset files that determine which rules are active. Ensure that the specified file exists and your MSBuild process has the right permissions to read it.

See [Using rule sets to group code analysis rules](../../code-quality/using-rule-sets-to-group-code-analysis-rules.md).
