# MSBuild error MSB8007

> MSB8007: The Platform for project '*project-name*' is invalid.  Platform='*platform-name*'. You may be seeing this message because you are trying to build a project without a solution file, and have specified a non-default Platform that doesn't exist for this project.

To resolve this issue, change the **Target Platform** property for your project to a valid value. For more information, see [General Property Page (Project)](/cpp/build/reference/general-property-page-project).
