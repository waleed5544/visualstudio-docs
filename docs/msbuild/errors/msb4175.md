# MSB4175: The task factory 'task-factory-name' could not be loaded from the assembly 'assembly-name'

This error occurs when MSBuild encounters a problem during the creation of a task using a task factory.

When MSBuild processes a UsingTask, a task factory builds an instance of a task that is then invoked. Typically, an assembly or DLL is used, but the task might also be created dynamically from code, as in the case of `CodeTaskFactory` and `RoslynTaskFactory`, or from XAML, as in the case of `XamlTaskFactory`. A second error might give more information on the cause of the failure. Common reasons for this error include:

- The task assembly couldn't be loaded. Check the path and permissions on the file.
- There's a coding error in the code used to dynamically create the task. The compiler error will be shown in a second error.
