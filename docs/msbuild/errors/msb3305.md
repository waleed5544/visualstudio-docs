# MSB3305: Processing COM reference 'reference' from path 'path'

This warning is a generic notification of an issue with a COM reference. Look to the additional error text for more detailed information.

One possible cause is an invalid type library (TLB file), which could be anything from a corrupt TLB file to a version mismatch.

A second possible cause is that there are types in a TLB that couldn't be converted to .NET types. These will be passed as a pointer, which requires unsafe code to work with.

As a temporary measure, you can silence this warning by adding the following to your project file:

```xml
<!-- Comment out or set to 'false' to get warnings about TLB conversion -->
<ResolveComReferenceSilent>true</ResolveComReferenceSilent>
```

> [!WARNING]
> We don't recommended suppressing MSBuild diagnostic information. Eliminating the warning won't address the underlying problem, and using the `ResolveComReferenceSilent` property to hide this warning might also hide other COM reference warnings you didn't intend to suppress.
