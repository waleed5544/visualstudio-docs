# MSBuild error MSB8019

> MSB8019: This build is consuming a component "*project-reference*" that is not packaged because the component is not coming from a Windows Store app project "*project-name*".

This error occurs when a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) or Windows Store project has a project reference to a component that isn't built for UWP or Windows Store app use. To fix this issue, modify your dependencies to use UWP-compatible components or libraries.
