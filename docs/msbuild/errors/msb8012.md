# MSBuild warning MSB8012

> MSB8012: TargetPath (*target-path*) does not match the Linker/Library OutputFile property value (*output-file-path*). This may cause your project to build incorrectly. To correct this, please make sure that $(OutDir), $(TargetName) and $(TargetExt) property values match the value specified in %(link/lib.OutputFile).

A target path, filename, or file extension passed to the linker or library tool didn't match the expected value. To resolve this issue, make sure the specified properties match in your project's compiler and linker properties. For more information, see [General Property Page (Project)](/cpp/build/reference/general-property-page-project) and [Linker Property Pages](/cpp/build/reference/linker-property-pages).
