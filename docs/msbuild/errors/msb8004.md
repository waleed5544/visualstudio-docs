# MSBuild warning MSB8004

> MSB8004: *property* Directory does not end with a trailing slash. This build instance will add the slash as it is required to allow proper evaluation of the *property* Directory.

This error can occur when your configuration doesn't include the trailing slash on an Intermediate or Output directory path.

To resolve this issue, add a trailing slash to the specified path in your configuration. You can set the **Output Directory** and **Intermediate Directory** properties for these paths in your project properties. For more information, see [General Property Page (Project)](/cpp/build/reference/general-property-page-project).
