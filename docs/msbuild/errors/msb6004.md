# MSB6004: The specified task executable location 'path' is invalid

This error occurs when an executable for a task could not be found. An MSBuild task that runs a tool typically fails if there is an installation problem with the tool or package that provides the tool.

To resolve this error:

- Check the executable to make sure it's installed at the expected path.
- Look at the error that came from the tool associated with this MSBuild task, if any. For example, if the tool normally generates a log file, check the logs.
- Check the installation of the package that is providing the tool. For example, if the tool is a compiler, try reinstalling the compiler or package that provides the compiler. In this context, a package could mean a NuGet package, an OS package, a Visual Studio extension, or any other installed product.
- Check that the location of the executable is on the PATH environment variable, or that any other expected environment variables are set.
- If your installation seems to be correct, check with the vendor that provides the tool to report the error.
