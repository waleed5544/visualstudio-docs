# MSBuild error MSB8013

> This project doesn't contain the Configuration and Platform combination of *configuration*&vert;*platform*. This error may also appear if some other project is trying to follow a project-to-project reference to this project, this project has been unloaded or is not included in the solution, and the referencing project does not build using the same or an equivalent Configuration or Platform.

- This error can occur when your project references another project that isn't loaded. One possible way to resolve the issue is to remove the project reference, then add it again. Or, you can add the referenced project to the solution as a build dependency instead of a reference.

- Check if the configuration and platform are unexpected (for example, "Debug|Win32" when building for Release). The build system uses these default values when the actual values aren't preserved. Set the specific configuration and platform values your project requires. Then, build it before another project that references it gets built.
