# MSBuild warning MSB8029

> MSB8029: The Intermediate directory or Output directory cannot reside under the Temporary directory as it could lead to issues with incremental build.

To resolve this issue:

- For each project in your solution, set your intermediate and output build directory properties for each supported configuration and platform to use a directory that's not under the Temporary directory.  To set the directories, select the project in Solution Explorer, then right-click to open the shortcut menu. Choose **Properties** to open the **Property Pages** dialog for the project. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Output Files** property page. For each configuration in the project, set the **Intermediate Directory** and **Output Directory** property.
