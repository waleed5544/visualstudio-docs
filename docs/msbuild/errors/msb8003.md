# MSBuild warning MSB8003

> MSB8003: The *property-name* property is not defined. Some build tools may not be found.

To resolve this issue, define a supported value for the specified property.

This error can occur when the `VCToolsInstallDir` property hasn't been set. This error may occur if you haven't installed a C++ workload in the Visual Studio Installer. You can use the Visual Studio Installer to install workloads and optional components. For more information, see [Modify Visual Studio](../../install/modify-visual-studio.md). Choose one of the C++ workloads to install the C/C++ toolset. Use the **Individual components** tab in the installer to choose specific platforms, libraries, and SDKs.

This error can also occur when the `WindowsSDKDir` property hasn't been set in your project. Since Visual Studio 2015, the Windows SDK hosts the headers and libraries for the C runtime library. We recommend you install and use the latest available Windows SDK in the Visual Studio Installer, and set the **Windows SDK Version** property in your project property pages to match.
