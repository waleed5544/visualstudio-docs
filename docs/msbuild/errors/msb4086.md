# MSB4086: A numeric comparison was attempted on 'expression' that evaluates to 'value' instead of a number, in condition 'condition'

This error occurs in an MSBuild project file when a number was expected in a condition expression, but the expression evaluated to a non-numeric value. If this error occurs in your project file, check the project file for syntax errors and other problems. For help with the syntax, see MSBuild conditions at [MSBuild conditions](../msbuild-conditions.md).

Check the MSBuild properties to see that you're using them as expected. Check that the properties used in the condition expression, especially those properties that are expected to have a numeric value, are set to a numeric value with the correct syntax.

This error can also be generated if there is a problem with setting the numeric value. The root cause could be another error, such as an installation issue. For example, if a version number of an installed tool was used in a condition expression, but the tool was not installed.
