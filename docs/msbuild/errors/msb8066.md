# MSBuild error MSB8066

> MSB8066: Custom build for '*item-list*' exited with code '*error-code*'

This error occurs when a custom build specified for a list of items exited with a non-zero error code.

To investigate the error, check the build output or build log to see if the custom build step produced an error with information about the problem. If not, try running it separately to check for any problems or unexpected behavior.

For more information, see [Understanding custom build steps and build events](/cpp/build/understanding-custom-build-steps-and-build-events).
