# MSBuild error MSB8024

> MSB8024: Using static version of the C++ runtime library is not supported.

When you specify the **`/MT`** or **`/MTd`** (Use multithreaded runtime library) linker options, you must use the dynamic library version of the Universal C Runtime Library (UCRT). 

To resolve this issue, modify the project to use the dynamic UCRT library. For more information, see [Upgrade your code to the Universal CRT](/cpp/porting/upgrade-your-code-to-the-universal-crt).
