This error can occur when using a makefile to build a project, and you haven't set the project properties **Build Command Line**, **Clean Command Line**, or **Rebuild All Command Line**.

To resolve this issue, add the specified build command lines to your project properties. For more information, see [NMake Property Page](/cpp/build/reference/nmake-property-page).
