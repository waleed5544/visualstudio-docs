# Item metadata in target batching

MSBuild has the ability to perform dependency analysis on the inputs and outputs of a build target. If it is determined that the inputs or outputs of the target are up-to-date, the target will be skipped and the build will proceed. `Target` elements use the `Inputs` and `Outputs` attributes to specify the items to inspect during dependency analysis.

If a target contains a task that uses batched items as inputs or outputs, the `Target` element of the target should use batching in its `Inputs` or `Outputs` attributes to enable MSBuild to skip batches of items that are already up-to-date.

## Batch targets

The following example contains an item list named `Res` that is divided into two batches based on the `Culture` item metadata. Each of these batches is passed into the `AL` task, which creates an output assembly for each batch. By using batching on the `Outputs` attribute of the `Target` element, MSBuild can determine if each of the individual batches is up-to-date before running the target. Without using target batching, both batches of items would be run by the task every time the target was executed.

```xml
<Project
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">

    <ItemGroup>
        <Res Include="Strings.fr.resources">
            <Culture>fr</Culture>
        </Res>
        <Res Include="Strings.jp.resources">
            <Culture>jp</Culture>
        </Res>
        <Res Include="Menus.fr.resources">
            <Culture>fr</Culture>
        </Res>
        <Res Include="Dialogs.fr.resources">
            <Culture>fr</Culture>
        </Res>
        <Res Include="Dialogs.jp.resources">
            <Culture>jp</Culture>
        </Res>
        <Res Include="Menus.jp.resources">
            <Culture>jp</Culture>
        </Res>
    </ItemGroup>

    <Target Name="Build"
        Inputs="@(Res)"
        Outputs="%(Culture)\MyApp.resources.dll">

        <AL Resources="@(Res)"
            TargetType="library"
            OutputAssembly="%(Culture)\MyApp.resources.dll">

    </Target>

</Project>
```
