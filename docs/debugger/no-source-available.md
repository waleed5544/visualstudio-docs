# No Source Available
Your project does not contain source code for the code that you are trying to view. The usual cause is double-clicking a module that does not have source code in the **Call Stack Window** or **Threads Window**. You can continue to debug, but cannot use the source window to set breakpoints and perform other actions at this location. If you need to set a breakpoint, use the **Disassembly Window** instead.

 In the Solution Property Pages, you can change the directories where the debugger looks for sources files and tell the debugger to ignore selected source files. See [Debug Source Files, Common Properties, Solution Property Pages Dialog Box](../debugger/debug-source-files-common-properties-solution-property-pages-dialog-box.md).

 **Browse to find source code**
 Click this link to open a dialog box where you can browse to find the source code.

 **Show Disassembly**
 Launches the **Disassembly Window**.

 **Always show disassembly for missing source files**
 Select this option to display the **Disassembly Window** automatically when no source is available. This setting can also be changed in the **Options** dialog box, **Debugging** category, **General** page, by selecting or clearing **Show disassembly if source is not available**.
