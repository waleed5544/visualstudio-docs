# COM Debugging Tools

This topic lists tools that can help you test and inspect COM programs.

OLE/COM Object Viewer

OLEVIEW displays the ActiveX and OLE objects installed on your computer and the interfaces they support. It also allows you to edit the registry and look at type libraries.

Microsoft Foundation Class Samples

The MFC ActiveX samples OCLIENT and SUPERPAD are also available to test your applications against. Full source code for these samples is included.
