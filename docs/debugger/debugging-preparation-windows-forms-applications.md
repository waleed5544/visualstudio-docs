# Debugging Preparation: Windows Forms Applications

The Windows Forms App project template creates a Windows Forms application. Debugging this type of application in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] is straightforward. For information on creating a project of this type, see [Create a Windows Form App](../ide/create-csharp-winform-visual-studio.md).

 When you create a Windows Forms project with the project template, [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] automatically creates required settings for the Debug and Release configurations. If necessary, you can change these settings. These settings can be changed in the **\<project name> Property Pages** dialog box (**My Project** in Visual Basic).

 For more information, see [Recommended Property Settings](../debugger/managed-debugging-recommended-property-settings.md).

 The following table displays one additional recommended property setting.

### Configuration Properties in Debug tab

|**Property Name**|**Setting**|
|-----------------------|-----------------|
|**Start Action**|-   Set to **Start project,** most of the time. Set to **Start external program** if you want to start another executable when you start debugging (usually for debugging DLLs).|

 You can debug Windows Forms applications from inside [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)], or by attaching to an already running application. For more information about attaching, see [Attach to Running Processes](../debugger/attach-to-running-processes-with-the-visual-studio-debugger.md).

### To debug a C#, F#, or Visual Basic Windows Forms application

1. Open the project in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)].

2. Create breakpoints as needed.

    Because Windows Forms applications are event-driven, your breakpoints will go into event handler code, or into methods called by event handler code. Typical events in which to place breakpoints include:

   1. Events associated with a control, such as Click, Enter, etc.

   2. Events associated with application startup and shutdown, such as Load, Activated, etc.

   3. Focus and Validation Events.

      For more information, see [Creating Event Handlers in Windows Forms](/dotnet/framework/winforms/creating-event-handlers-in-windows-forms).

3. On the **Debug** menu, click **Start**.

4. Debug using the techniques discussed in [First look at the debugger](../debugger/debugger-feature-tour.md).
