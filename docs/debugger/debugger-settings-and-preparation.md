# Debugger Settings and Preparation
This section describes the debugger-related property settings, and the preparation needed in order to debug your program with the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] debugger. If you create your program in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] using the project templates, these settings are set correctly for you in the Debug configuration.
