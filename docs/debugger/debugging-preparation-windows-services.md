# Debugging Preparation: Windows Services
A Windows service is a program that runs in the background under Microsoft Windows. Examples include the Telnet service and the Windows time service, which updates your computer's visible clock. A Windows service cannot be run from within [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)]; it must run within the context of the Services Control Manager. For more information, see [Creating Windows Services](/dotnet/framework/windows-services/how-to-create-windows-services), [Debugging Windows Service Applications](/dotnet/framework/windows-services/how-to-debug-windows-service-applications), and [Windows Service Applications](/dotnet/framework/windows-services/index).
