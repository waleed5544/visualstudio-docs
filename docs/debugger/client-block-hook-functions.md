# Client Block Hook Functions
If you want to validate or report the contents of the data stored in `_CLIENT_BLOCK` blocks, you can write a function specifically for this purpose. The function that you write must have a prototype similar to the following, as defined in CRTDBG.H:

```cpp
void YourClientDump(void *, size_t)
```

 In other words, your hook function should accept a **void** pointer to the beginning of the allocation block, together with a **size_t** type value indicating the size of the allocation, and return `void`. Other than that, its contents are up to you.

 Once you have installed your hook function using [_CrtSetDumpClient](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtsetdumpclient), it will be called every time a `_CLIENT_BLOCK` block is dumped. You can then use [_CrtReportBlockType](/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/crtreportblocktype) to get information on the type or subtype of dumped blocks.

 The pointer to your function that you pass to `_CrtSetDumpClient` is of type **_CRT_DUMP_CLIENT**, as defined in CRTDBG.H:

```cpp
typedef void (__cdecl *_CRT_DUMP_CLIENT)
   (void *, size_t);
```
