# Pseudovariables in the Visual Studio debugger
Pseudovariables are terms used to display certain information in a variable window or the **QuickWatch** dialog box. You can enter a pseudovariable the same way you would enter a normal variable. Pseudovariables are not variables, however, and do not correspond to variable names in your program.

## Example
 Suppose you are writing a native code application and want to see the number of handles allocated in your application. In the **Watch** window, you can enter the following pseudovariable in the **Name** column, then press Return to evaluate it:

`$handles`

 In native code, you can use the pseudovariables shown in the following table:

|Pseudovariable|Function|
|--------------------|--------------|
|`$err`|Displays the last error value set with the function SetLastError. The value that is displayed represents what would be returned by the GetLastError function.<br /><br /> Use `$err,hr` to see the decoded form of this value. For example, if the last error was 3, the `$err,hr` would display `ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND : The system cannot find the path specified.`|
|`$handles`|Displays the number of handles allocated in your application.|
|`$vframe`|Displays the address of the current stack frame.|
|`$tid`|Displays the thread ID for the current thread.|
|`$env`|Displays the environment block in the string viewer.|
|`$cmdline`|Displays the command line string that launched the program.|
|`$pid`|Displays the process ID.|
|`$` *registername*<br /><br /> or<br /><br /> `@` *registername*|Displays the contents of the register *registername*.<br /><br /> Normally, you can display register contents just by entering the register name. The only time you need to use this syntax is when the register name overloads a variable name. If the register name is the same as a variable name in the current scope, the debugger interprets the name as a variable name. That's when `$`*registername* or `@`*registername* comes in handy.|
|`$clk`|Displays the time in clock cycles.|
|`$user`|Displays a structure with account information for the account running the application. For security reasons, the password information is not displayed.|
|`$exceptionstack`|Displays the stack trace of the current Windows Runtime exception. `$ exceptionstack` works only in UWP apps. `$ exceptionstack` is not supported for C++ and SEH exceptions|
|`$returnvalue`|Displays the return value of a method.|

 In C# you can use the pseudovariables shown in the following table:

|Pseudovariable|Function|
|--------------------|--------------|
|`$exception`|Displays information on the last exception. If no exception has occurred, evaluating `$exception` displays an error message.<br /><br /> When the Exception Assistant is disabled, `$exception` is automatically added to the **Locals** window when an exception occurs.|
|`$user`|Displays a structure with account information for the account running the application. For security reasons, the password information is not displayed.|
|`$returnvalue`|Displays the return value of a .NET method.|

 In Visual Basic, you can use the pseudovariables shown in the following table:

|Pseudovariable|Function|
|--------------------|--------------|
|`$exception`|Displays information on the last exception. If no exception has occurred, evaluating `$exception` displays an error message.|
|`$delete` or `$$delete`|Deletes an implicit variable that was created in the **Immediate** window. The syntax is `$delete,` *variable* or`$delete,` *variable*`.`|
|`$objectids` or `$listobjectids`|Displays all active Object IDs as children of the specified expression. The syntax is `$objectid,` *expression* or`$listobjectids,` *expression*`.`|
|`$` *N* `#`|Displays object with Object ID equal to *N*.|
|`$dynamic`|Displays the special **Dynamic View** node for an object that implements the `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`. Interface. The syntax is `$dynamic,` *object*. This feature applies only to code that uses .NET Framework version 4 or later.|
