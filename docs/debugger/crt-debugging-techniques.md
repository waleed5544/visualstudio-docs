# CRT Debugging Techniques
If you are debugging a program that uses the C run-time library, these debugging techniques might be useful.

## In This Section
 [CRT Debug Library Use](../debugger/crt-debug-library-use.md)

 Describes the debugging support provided by the C Run-Time Library and provides instructions for accessing the tools.

 [Macros for Reporting](../debugger/macros-for-reporting.md)

 Provides information about the **_RPTn** and **_RPTFn** macros (defined in CRTDBG.H), which replace the use of `printf` statements for debugging.

 [Debug Versions of Heap Allocation Functions](../debugger/debug-versions-of-heap-allocation-functions.md)

 Discusses the special Debug versions of the heap allocation functions, including: how the CRT maps calls, the benefits of calling them explicitly, how to avoid conversion, tracking the separate types of allocations in client blocks, and the results of not defining _DEBUG.

 [CRT Debug Heap Details](../debugger/crt-debug-heap-details.md)

 Provides links to memory management and the debug heap, types of blocks on the debug heap, using the debug heap, heap state reporting functions, and tracking heap allocation requests.

 [Debug Hook Function Writing](../debugger/debug-hook-function-writing.md)

 Lists links to client block hook functions, allocation hook functions, allocation hooks and CRT memory allocations, and report hook functions.

 [Finding Memory Leaks Using the CRT Library](../debugger/finding-memory-leaks-using-the-crt-library.md)

 Covers techniques for detecting and isolating memory leaks by using the debugger and the C Run-Time Library.
