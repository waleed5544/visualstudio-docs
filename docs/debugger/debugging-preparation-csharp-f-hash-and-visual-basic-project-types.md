# Debugging Preparation: C#, F#, and Visual Basic Project Types

The topics in this section describe how to debug the C#, F#, and [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] project types created by the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] project templates.

 Note that those project types that create DLLs as their output have been grouped into [Debugging DLL Projects](../debugger/debugging-dll-projects.md) because of the common features they share.

## In This Section

 [Recommended Property Settings](../debugger/managed-debugging-recommended-property-settings.md)
 This section describes the recommended debugging-related property settings for C#, F#, and Visual Basic projects.

 [Windows Forms Applications](../debugger/debugging-preparation-windows-forms-applications.md)
 Describes a Windows Forms App project and provides instructions for debugging, changing the default Debug configuration, and starting the application outside of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] and attaching to it.

 [Console Projects](../debugger/debugging-preparation-console-projects.md)
 Provides additional considerations for debugging C# or [!INCLUDE[vbprvb](../code-quality/includes/vbprvb_md.md)] console applications. This includes specifying command-line arguments, starting your application from the command prompt, writing to the Output window, and troubleshooting the Console window.

 [Windows Services](../debugger/debugging-preparation-windows-services.md)
 Describes a Windows service and provides a link to Debugging Windows Service Applications.
