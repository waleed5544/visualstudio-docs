# CaptureCurrentFrame
Captures the remainder of the current frame to the graphics log file.

## Syntax

```C++
void CaptureCurrentFrame();
```

## Remarks
 If another capture is currently in progress—such as a capture that was started by the `BeginCapture` function—then that capture is completed and recorded to the graphics log as a distinct frame. Immediately afterwards, graphics diagnostics begins capturing the remainder of the current frame, which is also recorded as a distinct frame. The current frame's end is marked by a call to present.

 To capture a frame, you must prepare your app to capture and record graphics information—that is, you must have called [Init](init.md) through an instance of the `VsgDbg` class before you call `CaptureCurrentFrame`.
