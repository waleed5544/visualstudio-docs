# AddMessage
Adds a custom message to the graphics diagnostics *HUD* (Head-Up Display).

## Syntax

```C++
void AddMessage(
  wchar_t const * szMessage
);
```

#### Parameters
 `szMessage`
 The message to be added to the HUD.

## Remarks
 The graphics diagnostics HUD is displayed in the upper-left corner of the app that's running under graphics diagnostics. It displays run-time information about the app and about graphics information capture, and messages that are added by calling this function.

 To add a message to the HUD, you don't have to be actively capturing graphics informationâ€”that is, a message can be added through an instance of the `VsgDbg` class, but the [Init](init.md) member function does not to be called first. Messages are only displayed in the HUD, they are not recorded in the graphics log file.
