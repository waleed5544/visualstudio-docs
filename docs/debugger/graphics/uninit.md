# UnInit
Finalizes the graphics log file, closes it, and frees resources that were used while the app was actively recording graphics information.

## Syntax

```C++
void UnInit();
```

## Remarks
 `UnInit` is called automatically when an instance of the `VsgDbg` class is destroyed. If the `VsgDbg` instance was not actively recording graphics information, this has no effect.

 After `UnInit` has been called on an instance of the `VsgDbg` class, a new graphics log file can be created by calling `Init` and finalized by calling `UnInit`. You can repeat this as many times as you want to use the same `VsgDbg` instance to create several independent graphics log files.
