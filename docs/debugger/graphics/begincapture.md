# BeginCapture
Begins a capture interval that will end with `EndCapture`.

## Syntax

```C++
void BeginCapture();
```

## Remarks
 A capture interval typically spans a subset of one frame, such as when you want to capture graphics information only about a certain kind of draw call. If the capture interval spans a call to present, then two frames of graphics information are captured. The first frame spans the interval between the call to `BeginCapture` and the call to present; the second frame spans the interval between the first Direct3D event after the call to present and the call to `EndCapture`.

 To capture an interval, you must prepare your app to capture and record graphics informationâ€”that is, you must have called [Init](init.md) through an instance of the `VsgDbg` class before you call `BeginCapture` or `EndCapture`.
