# Source Server Security Alert
When using Source Server, only use symbol files that are from a known and trusted location.

 This warning appears when you enable Source Server support. Source Server commands are embedded in debug symbol files (**\*.pdb** files). Make sure you know where your PDB files come from.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following potential security threats must be taken into account when using Source Server: Arbitrary commands can be embedded in the application's PDB file, so make sure you put only the ones you want to execute in the srcsrv.ini file. Any attempt to execute a command not in the srcsvr.ini file will cause a confirmation dialog box to appear. For more information, see [Security Warning: Debugger Must Execute Untrusted Command](../debugger/security-warning-debugger-must-execute-untrusted-command.md). No validation is done on command parameters, so be careful with trusted commands. For example, if you trusted cmd.exe, a malicious user might specify parameters that would make the command dangerous.
