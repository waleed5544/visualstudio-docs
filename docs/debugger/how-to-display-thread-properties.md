# How to: Display Thread Properties
To find out more about a thread listed in [Threads View](../debugger/threads-view.md), use the [Thread Properties Dialog Box](../debugger/thread-properties-dialog-box.md).

### To open a Thread Properties dialog box

1. Select a thread from the tree displayed in [Threads View](../debugger/threads-view.md).

2. From the **View** menu, choose **Properties**.

   Properties dialog boxes are not modal, so you can click on another item in a view window and the dialog box will show information on the selected item.
