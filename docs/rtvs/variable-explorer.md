# Variable Explorer

The **Variable Explorer** window, opened using **R Tools** > **Windows** > **Variable Explorer** (or **Ctrl**+**8** if you've used **R Tools** > **Data Science Settings**), shows all variables at a given scope in the current R session. For example, if you open the **Variable Explorer** and enter the following lines in the [interactive window](interactive-repl-for-r-in-visual-studio.md):

```R
x <- 42
y <- 43
n <- c(1,2,3,5,8,13)
```

The **Variable Explorer** window then appears as follows:

If you have a more complex R data frame defined in the session, you can navigate into the data. For example, after running `cars <- mtcars` you can navigate through the dataset by expanding the different nodes in the **Variable Explorer**:

To delete variables, right-click and select **Delete**, or select the variable and press the **Delete** key.

You can also search for an observation in a data frame using incremental search. First, expand the nodes in the data frame that you want to search, then enter search terms in the search box.

## Details (table) view

Because data is often tabular, you can view any complex data type as a separate table by selecting the magnifying glass icon or right-clicking and selecting **Show Details**.

Clicking on a column heading sorts the data by column (alternating between ascending and descending). Holding down **Shift** and clicking on additional columns adds those columns to the sorting as well. Clicking a column without **Shift** returns to single column sorting.

The sequence in which you click the column headings determines the order in which the sorting is performed. For example, **Shift**+**click** the **cyl** column, then **Shift**+**click** the **mpg** column twice to sort the list for ascending cylinders and descending miles-per-gallon:

Because **Variable Explorer** and the table views are in separate Visual Studio windows, you can arrange them however you like for side-by-side work. See [Customize window layouts in Visual Studio](../ide/customizing-window-layouts-in-visual-studio.md) for general instructions.

## Open in Excel (or other CSV-capable application)

For further manipulation and analysis, it's often useful to export session variables to CSV. Exporting is done with the small Excel icon (![Excel export icon](media/variable-explorer-excel-icon.png)) next to each node in the **Variable Explorer**, or by right-clicking an item and selecting **Open in CSV App**. Selecting the icon writes the data to a new CSV file in the *%userprofile%\Documents\RTVS_CSV_Exports* folder and then launches that file, which opens it in whatever application is associated with the *.csv* extension.

## Scopes

By default the **Variable Explorer** opens to the global scope. You can switch to a package scope by selecting a package from the drop-down at the top of the window.

You can also switch to a function scope when stopped at a breakpoint in the debugger (note that **Variable Explorer** does not automatically switch to the function scope of the code being debugged):

**Variable Explorer** automatically changes function scope as you step through code in the debugger, such as showing local variables in a function.

## Import data into Variable Explorer

Two commands on the **Variable Explorer** toolbar, which are also available through the **R Tools** > **Data** menu, import external CSV datasets into your R session:  **Import Dataset into R Session from Web URL** and **Import Dataset into R Session from Text File**.

Once you've identified the CSV file to import, Visual Studio displays an **Import Dataset** dialog in which you have options to control how that data file is parsed (that is, what the field separator is and how to handle quotes). You can also see a preview of the imported data frame and the original data file:
