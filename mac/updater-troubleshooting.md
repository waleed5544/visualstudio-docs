# Troubleshooting: Updater has errors retrieving information

On a rare occasion, you may see the error message "Error retrieving update information" displayed when you try to [update Visual Studio for Mac](update.md). If this happens, try the following steps to fix it:

- Check your internet connection. A drop in the connection is the most common cause of this error.
  - If a component fails to download, you can click the retry button next to the component name to try the download again.
- Restart the IDE.
- If you continue to see this error message, you can also try to update using the Installer, if the **.dmg** is still on your machine, or you can download it from [visualstudio.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)
  - The installer will update any installed components on your machine.
  - By re-running the installer, you'll also be able to install any missing components that you had not previously installed.
- You can also try clearing your cached downloads, by deleting the file located at `~/Library/Caches/VisualStudio/8.0/TempDownload/index.xml`.
- If you're working with an older version of Visual Studio for Mac, you might have other version numbers under the `VisualStudio` directory. Delete the `index.xml` file in these paths as well.
