# Visual Studio for Mac Workloads

Visual Studio for Mac comes pre-installed with workloads for developing the following types of app:

* Cross-platform mobile apps with .NET using Xamarin, for Android, iOS, tvOS, and watchOS
* Mac desktop apps
* .NET Core apps
* ASP.NET Core Web apps
* Cross-platform Unity games

## Mobile applications with Xamarin

[Xamarin](xamarin.md) allows you to create cross-platform mobile apps with .NET for Android, iOS, tvOS, watchOS, and Mac desktop apps.

For information on using Xamarin in Visual Studio for Mac, refer to the [Xamarin Developer Center](https://developer.xamarin.com/) and check out the Mobile apps [hands-on lab](https://github.com/Microsoft/vs4mac-labs/tree/master/Mobile/Getting-Started).

## Mac desktop applications

You can build Mac apps with [Xamarin.Mac](/xamarin/mac/) using the Cocoa user interface framework, and [Xamarin.Forms on Mac](/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/other/mac) to build apps that share code and UI with other platforms.

## .NET Core applications

For more information on using .NET Core, refer to the [documentation](/dotnet/core/).

## ASP.NET Core Web Applications

For information on getting started using ASP.NET Core in Visual Studio for Mac, refer to the [Getting Started with ASP.NET Core](asp-net-core.md) guide or check out the ASP.NET Core web apps [hands-on lab](https://github.com/Microsoft/vs4mac-labs/tree/master/Web/Getting-Started).

## Unity game development

To start building games with Unity, see the [Setup page](setup-vsmac-tools-unity.md) and the [guide to using Unity Tools](using-vsmac-tools-unity.md), or check out the Unity [hands-on lab](https://github.com/Microsoft/vs4mac-labs/tree/master/Unity/Getting-Started).
