# Why does my dashboard shows Microsoft removed a subscriber? 
In the **Recent changes** section of the Dashboard on the [admin portal](https://manage.visualstudio.com), you may see that subscriptions have been removed, and the reason is shown as "Account closed".  There are two reasons this may occur.  

## Subscribers request closure of their Microsoft accounts
If a subscriber requests closure of a Microsoft account (MSA) that is used to sign in to their subscription, the subscription will be removed when the MSA is closed.  

For more information including important things to consider before closing an account, see [How to close your Microsoft account](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/how-to-close-your-microsoft-account-c1b2d13f-4de6-6e1b-4a31-d9d668849979).

## Subscribers are removed from Azure Active Directory tenant
When a subscriber whose subscription was assigned automatically using an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group is removed from that group, the subscription is automatically removed.  

## What happens when the account is closed?
If the subscription is removed, the subscriber will immediately lose access to the subscription.  If a subscriber is removed from an Azure AD group, their subscription information will be permanently removed within 180 days.  If a subscriber closes their MSA, their information is removed immediately.
