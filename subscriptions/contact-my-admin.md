# Get assistance from your subscriptions admin
If your Visual Studio subscription is provided to you by your work or school, chances are it was assigned to you by a subscriptions admin, or "admin".  Admins can assign or remove subscriptions, change sign-in email addresses, determine whether you have the ability to download software, and perform other functions related to your subscription.

Given the size and complexity of many organizations, you may not be aware of who your admin is, so it can be tough to know where to get help.  We provide a feature in the subscriber portal to assist you with contacting your admin(s).   

## How to contact your admin
1. Sign in to the subscriber portal at <https://my.visualstudio.com>
2. Select the **Subscriptions** tab. 
3. Select the **Contact my Admin** button at the top right. 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Contact my Admin](_img/contact-my-admin/contact-my-admin-button.png "Select the Contact my Admin button, enter your message, and select Send.")
4. Enter the message for your admin.
5. If you'd like to receive a copy of the message sent to your admin, choose the **Send me a copy** checkbox. 
6. Finally, select **Send**.

> [!NOTE]
> **Super admins:**  To set the email address to which "Contact my Admin" requests are sent, specify that address in the [Agreement Preferences](admin-preferences.md#contact-email-address).
