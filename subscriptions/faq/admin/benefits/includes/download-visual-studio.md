## How do my developers download Visual Studio?
The developers' assigned subscription levels identify which level of the Visual Studio IDE they have access to. For example, a Visual Studio Professional subscription does not have access to Visual Studio Enterprise. Make sure that you have assigned the correct level. 

### For the latest release
1.	Have your subscribers sign into the subscriptions portal at <https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits>. 
0.	Locate the Visual Studio IDE tile in the Tools section and click on the **Download** link at the bottom of the benefit tile. 
0.	They’ll be redirected to the Download Results page for Visual Studio to download the IDE. 
0.	Follow the download and set up instructions.
0.	Using the email their subscription is assigned to, they’ll be able to immediately sign into the IDE after installation; no product key is required. [Learn how to claim a product key](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/find-keys) for use in an offline environment.

### Find older versions
Your subscribers can also search and download previous versions from the [downloads page](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads) in the subscriptions portal at <https://my.visualstudio.com>.
