## How do I view my invoice for monthly and annual subscriptions?

Monthly Visual Studio subscriptions (and annual subscriptions if purchased before December 2018) are billed through Azure and you can find your bill in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

To view your Visual Studio subscriptions invoice:
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 
0. Click on the **Cost Management + Billing** blade in the menu to find an overview, list of subscriptions, and invoices.
