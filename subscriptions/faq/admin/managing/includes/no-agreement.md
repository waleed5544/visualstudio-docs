## Why am I not seeing an agreement while logged into the portal?

If you are logged into <https://manage.visualstudio.com/> and do not see an agreement you manage:
1. Check if youâ€™re signed in with the correct email address and tenant in the upper right-hand corner of the portal page header.
2. Contact the super admin who added you as an admin to see what alias you should be using, if you were removed, or if the agreement has expired.
If none of these simple solutions solves the issue, contact support to determine if you are in fact an admin on an agreement.
