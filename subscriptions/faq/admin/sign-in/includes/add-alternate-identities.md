## What does it mean when my subscribers add alternate identities?

Adding an alternate account allows your developers to access some of their Visual Studio subscription benefits (VS IDE, Azure DevOps, and Azure) with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to. An alternate ID doesn't provide a copy of the subscription to the other account; it only provides access to the two benefits with the alternate account. [Read more about Visual Studio Subscription identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity).
