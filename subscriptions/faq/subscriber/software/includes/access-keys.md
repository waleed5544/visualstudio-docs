## How do I access my product keys when my subscription expires?

To have access to your product keys after your subscription expires, you need to export your claimed keys before the subscription expires. After it expires you will not be able to retrieve your keys.

To export your keys, simply click on the Export all keys link at the far right of the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/ProductKeys) page. An .xml file entitled KeysExport.xml will be created, and you'll have the option to open or save the file. You will need to open the file with an application capable of handling .xml files. For example, you can open the file as a read-only workbook in Excel. The file will contain any keys you've claimed, as well as any \'static\' keys that are automatically claimed for you.
