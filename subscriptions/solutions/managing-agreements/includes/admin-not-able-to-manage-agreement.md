## I'm a super admin or admin, but I’m not able to manage my agreement

After you sign into the admin portal, you can assign, edit, and remove users on all agreements you have permission to manage. If you have multiple agreements, you'll see an agreement dropdown menu above the assigned subscriptions panel, allowing you to move between them. 

You can only take action on the active agreements. When an agreement has expired, even if the subscriptions are still assigned, you'll no longer be able to manage them. If you need help with moving your subscribers to a new agreement, contact support by using the "Online request" button below.
