## Why does my agreement still show an old end date after renewal?
Depending on how your renewal was processed, you may still have the same agreement number, or you may be issued a new one. If your agreement is still reflecting an old end date, then click on the agreement drop-down menu to see if there's a new agreement available. Select that agreement number to see your available subscriptions and start managing. 

If you do not see a new agreement, reach out to your super admin and verify you have been granted permissions to the new agreement number. Once you’ve been added to the new agreement, you’ll have access to manage subscriptions again.
