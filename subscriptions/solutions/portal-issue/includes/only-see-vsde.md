## Why am I only seeing Visual Studio Dev Essentials?

If you're not seeing all of your subscriptions, the most common causes are:

- **Your subscriptions are associated with different email aliases.**  For example, if your Dev Essentials membership is associated with your Microsoft Account (MSA), which typically uses an email address like myname@outlook.com, and you have subscriptions provided to you by your work or school that are associated to a different alias such as myname@contoso.com. 

    To see those subscriptions, you'll need to sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) with the appropriate credentials.  

- **You need to change which subscription is displayed.** If you have multiple subscriptions associated with the email you use to sign in, you can switch between them in two ways:
    - Go to the [Subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) to display a list of your subscriptions and click on the one you wish to use. 
    - Click the Subscription picker at the top-right of the [Benefits page](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and choose the desired subscription. 

- **Your subscription has been removed.**  If your subscription was provided to you by your work or school, your admin may have removed it. [Contact your subscriptions admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) for assistance.

- **Your subscription may have expired.** If you purchased your own subscription from Microsoft Store, it may have expired. In that case, you would need to renew it to regain access.
