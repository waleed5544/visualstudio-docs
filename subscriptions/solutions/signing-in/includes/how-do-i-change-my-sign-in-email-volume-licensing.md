## How to change your sign-in email address

If your work or school purchased subscriptions through Volume Licensing or the Visual Studio Marketplace, those subscriptions are managed by admins. An admin can change the email address you use to sign into your subscription.  

## How to contact your admin 

Given the size and complexity of many organizations, you may not be aware of who your admin is. You can use the **Contact my admin** feature in the subscriptions portal to assist with contacting your admin. 

1. Navigate to the [Subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) in the portal  
2. Click the **Contact my Admin** button at the top right
3. Enter the message for your admin
4. If you'd like to receive a copy of the message sent to your admin, check the **Send me a copy** checkbox 
5. Click **Send**
