## Should I use Microsoft Account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)?

An MSA is an email account that is owned and maintained by you to access Microsoft services. If you leave the company, you can still access services that are connected to that identity. Until access is manually removed in the admin portal, you can continue using an assigned Visual Studio subscription or manage agreements.

Azure AD is a cloud-based tenant managed by your organization. Your Azure AD account can be used to control access to Microsoft services. When you leave the company and your account is deactivated, you can no longer sign in with this email address.

We recommend using Azure AD since the admin portal can automatically manage unauthorized access. When you deactivate a person's account in Azure AD, access to a subscription or the admin portal will also be blocked.
