## How to become a Visual Studio subscriptions admin or super admin 

Organizations who purchase Visual Studio subscriptions through Volume Licensing use admins and super admins to manage subscriptions. Only super admins can assign administrative rights to users. To become an admin or super admin, contact a super admin in your organization.  

If you have a subscription assigned to you, sign in to the [Subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) and click the **Contact my Admin** button. More information is available in our [Contact my Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin) article.

## How to become a super admin for Visual Studio subscriptions agreements managed by partners

If there are no super admins in your organization and you purchase your subscriptions through a partner or reseller, contact your partner/reseller for assistance with appointing super admins. It's recommended that every agreement has at least two super admins.
