## How can I change the sign-in email address on my Visual Studio cloud subscription?

If you purchased one or more cloud subscriptions yourself, you are set up as an admin with the ability to make changes to the subscriptions. To change the sign-in email address for a subscription, you need to edit your subscription in the Visual Studio Subscriptions admin portal.

1. Navigate to the [Manage subscribers](https://manage.visualstudio.com/subscribers) page in the admin portal
2. Locate your subscription in the list, click on the **...** and choose **Edit**
3. Your subscription information will be displayed in a fly-out pane on the right
4. Change the email address 
5. Click **Save**

Editing your subscription email address doesn't change your sign-in for the admin portal.
