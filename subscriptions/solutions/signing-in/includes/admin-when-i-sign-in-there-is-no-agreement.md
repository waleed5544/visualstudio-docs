## When I sign into the admin portal, I don’t see any agreements to manage

Make sure you’re signing into the admin portal using the email address that you were assigned with. If you don’t know which email address to use, check your inbox for the super admin or admin welcome email. If you can't find your welcome email, contact your super admin to verify your sign-in information.

If you have multiple tenants, check the tenant picker in the top-right corner to see if you are in the correct tenant. If you have multiple tenants and don’t have an agreement associated to all, you may see the message that you don’t have any agreements to manage when in that tenant.  

## Expired agreement

You may also receive this message once your agreement has expired, since you'll no longer have access. Other active agreements you manage won't be affected.
