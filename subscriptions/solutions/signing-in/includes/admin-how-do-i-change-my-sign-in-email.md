## How do I update my sign-in email address without losing permissions? 
Admins who need to make a change to their sign-in email address must contact their super admin and ask them to make the update for you. Super admins on your agreement are denoted by the green checkmark in the Super admin column in the super admins list located in the **Agreement details** flyout panel on the left .   

Super admins can create new admins and super admins. To change your own sign-in address, follow the steps below.

1. Navigate to the [Manage administrators](https://manage.visualstudio.com/administrators) page in the admin portal 
2. Click **Add**
3. Enter your name 
4. Enter the email address you wish to use to sign in
5. Check the **Super admin** checkbox
0. Click **Save**
0. Select the entry in the list of admins that shows your old sign-in email address
0. Click the **"..."** and choose **Delete** or click **Delete** on the menu at the top of the list
0. Click **Confirm**

As long as your agreement has a minimum of two super admins, you can remove your old email address. For security reasons, it's required to have a minimum of two super admins on the agreement.
