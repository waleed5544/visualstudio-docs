## I'm unable to activate my Pluralsight benefit

Depending on which Visual Studio subscription or program membership you have, you may be eligible for up to six months of free access to Pluralsight. Verify your subscription includes the Pluralsight benefit on the [benefits comparison page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/benefits/#azure?cat=visual-studio-enterprise-subscription).

## How to activate your Pluralsight benefit
  
1. Sign in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and click the Activate link on the Pluralsight benefit tile located in the Professional Development section on the Benefits page. 
1. You'll be redirected to complete the Pluralsight subscription sign-up form for the benefit level that's included with your Visual Studio subscription. This registration page expires after a few minutes. If you don't complete the registration process before the page expires, return to step 1.
1. You'll see a confirmation on the page and be asked to set a password. 
1. After you activate your Pluralsight benefit, the appearance of the tile in the Visual Studio subscriptions portal will change to help you track the status of your benefit. You may need to refresh the portal to see the change. 

## Subscriptions renewal and the Pluralsight benefit
The Pluralsight benefit in selected Visual Studio subscriptions renews when your subscription renews. For example, if you have an annual subscription that you renew each year, the benefit is available to you each year when you renew. If you have a multi-year subscription, the Pluralsight benefit is available to you once during the term of the subscription. If you renew a multi-year subscription, the benefit will be available again following the renewal. To find your renewal date, visit <https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions> and click *Support Information* and locate the "Valid through:" date.
