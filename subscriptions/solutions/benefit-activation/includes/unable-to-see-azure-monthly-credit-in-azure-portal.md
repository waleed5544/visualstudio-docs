## I'm unable to see my Azure monthly credit in the Azure portal

There are multiple reasons you might not be able to see the Azure monthly credit. You may be using the wrong email to sign in, you may be signed in with the correct email but in the wrong directory, or you may not have yet activated your monthly credit benefit. 

## Azure subscription account 

When you activate your monthly credit, we link the email that you used during activation with your Visual Studio subscription.  

You can also associate an [alternate account](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-alternate-identity) with your Visual Studio subscription. Adding an alternate account to your Visual Studio subscription allows you to access the subscription benefits, like Azure DevOps and Azure, with a different identity than that which the subscription is assigned to.  

You'll need to sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the email you set up the account with. For example, if you activated your monthly credit with your alternate account, you must always sign into your Azure subscription with that email. 

## Azure directories
 
You can have multiple directories as part of your Azure subscription. Make sure you're using the directory you set up the Azure subscription. You can view and switch directories by clicking on the account icon in the top-right corner in the Azure portal.
