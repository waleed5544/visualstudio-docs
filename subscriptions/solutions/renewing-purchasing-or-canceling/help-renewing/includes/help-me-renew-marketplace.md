## Renewing subscriptions through Visual Studio Marketplace 

As long as your payment method is still valid, your Visual Studio subscriptions through Marketplace are auto renewed. Read more about [Visual Studio Subscriptions Azure billing](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vscloud-billing-faq). 

If you do not wish to renew a subscription, reduce your number of paid users in [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). The new monthly billing amount and reduced users will take effect on the 1st of the next month.
