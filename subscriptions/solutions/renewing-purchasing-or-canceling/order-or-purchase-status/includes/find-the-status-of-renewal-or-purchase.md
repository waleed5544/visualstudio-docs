## How do I find the status of my renewal or purchase?

Check the status of your subscriptions and their end dates in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions). Here you can view the subscription level, subscription ID, and the valid through date. Once a subscription has been successfully activated or renewed, you will see it updated on this page.
