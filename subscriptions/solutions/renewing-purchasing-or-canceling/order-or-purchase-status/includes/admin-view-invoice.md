## Where can I view my invoice?

To locate your invoice, it will depend on the method of purchase you did for your subscriptions.

Monthly and annual subscriptions purchased from the Visual Studio Marketplace are billed through Azure. Your invoices can be viewed in the Azure portal
1. Sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click on “Cost Management + Billing” in the menu
3. Click on list of subscriptions, and then invoices

If you purchased your subscriptions through a Volume Licensing agreement, contact your reseller for additional information.
