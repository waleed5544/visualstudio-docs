## How do I view my invoice?

Your Azure invoice can include payments for Azure services and some types of Visual Studio subscriptions.

## To view your invoice
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).  
2. Click on the Cost Management + Billing blade in the menu to find an overview, list of subscriptions, and invoices.  

## Visual Studio subscriptions 

Monthly (and annual if purchased before December 2018) subscriptions are billed through Azure, you will find your invoice in the same Azure billing section.  

## Understanding spending limit 
The spending limit feature in Azure allows you to set a spending limit where services will be turned off. By default this is already applied to the Azure dev/test individual credit benefit. â€¯[Read more about the Azure spending limit](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/spending-limit). 

If you have removed the spending cap on your Azure subscription, converted to Pay-As-You-Go, are taking advantage of enterprise dev/test pricing only available to Visual Studio subscribers, or want to utilize services outside of those used for development and testing covered by the monthly credit, you will be billed monthly for services.
