## Some subscriptions are missing that I didn’t delete. Where did the subscriptions go?
As the super admin or admin, you can add, edit, or remove subscribers from any agreement when you have the proper permissions. 

However, it’s a best practice to have more than one admin per agreement with the same capabilities. If you notice changes that you didn’t make, complete the following steps to determine who made the changes.

1. Select the **Dashboard** tab above the subscriber grid.
2. Browse to the **Recent changes** tile.
3. Select the **View all changes** link at the bottom-right corner, or choose the Excel icon in the upper-right corner to export a file.

These steps allow you to view a report of the changes made over the last 30 days. For privacy reasons, we only retain information for the last 30 days.

## Account closed by subscriber 
Subscriptions might be missing if a subscriber requested Microsoft to close their account. When we receive requests for account closure, we're required to delete the subscriber data. In this scenario, we're not able to identify the user who submitted the request.
