## How do I assign a subscription?

As a super admin or admin, you can assign an individual subscriber by following these steps: 
1. Make sure you’re looking at the correct agreement on the left above the subscriber grid.
2. Next, select **Add**, and then select **Individual subscriber**.
3. Enter all of the required information, and then select **Add**.

## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) 

The admin must be a member of the Azure AD tenant to use this method.

1. Confirm you have the correct tenant selected in the upper-right corner.
2. Make sure you’re looking at the correct agreement on the left above the subscriber grid.
3. Select **Add**, and then select **Individual subscriber**.
4. If your organization uses Azure AD, the **Name** field acts as a search function to find people in your current directory. You can select the correct user from the search results.
5. After you select the user, the sign-in email and notification email are automatically populated. You can change the values, as needed.
6. Enter all of the required information, and then select **Add**.
