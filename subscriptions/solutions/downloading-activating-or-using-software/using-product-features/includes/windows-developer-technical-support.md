## Windows developer technical support  

Visual Studio subscriptions support provides assistance with sales, subscriptions, accounts, and billing for Visual Studio subscriptions. 
If you have a Windows technical or developer account issue, your question needs to be directed to [Windows developer support](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/support/?utm_source=developermscom). We suggest trying these other resources first. 

## Windows technical documentation 
Review tutorials, troubleshooting guides, helpful resources, and a range of other topics within [Windows technical documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/).

## Windows developer account
Your Visual Studio subscription may include a Windows developer account. Activate your account by visiting the [subscriptions portal benefits page](https://my.visualstudio.com/Benefits) and clicking on the benefit tile. 

Read more about the [Windows developer account benefit](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/vs-windows-dev).
