## I'm unable to find or claim a product key.

The product keys available to you depend on the Visual Studio subscription you're using.  

## View a list of available product keys 

The [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page lists all keys available to you in aggregate. You can edit the notes column for identifying when and why you claimed the key. There are different key types, depending on the product. Some keys you’ll need to claim and others will be visible to you right away. 

If you don’t see a key or product, it’s possible that the product is not available for your subscription level. You can [download an extensive list](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/5/4/15454442-CF17-47B9-A65D-DF84EF88511B/Visual_Studio_by_Subscription_Level.xlsx) of available software titles for all subscription types. To check what types are assigned to you, view your subscriptions in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions).
