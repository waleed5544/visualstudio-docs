## I'm Unable to download or activate Visual Studio Community
Visual Studio Community is the free, lightweight version of the IDE and you do not need a paid Visual Studio subscription to use it. You can [download this directly](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) from the Visual Studio website.
