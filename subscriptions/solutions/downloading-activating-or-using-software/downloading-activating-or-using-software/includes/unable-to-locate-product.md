## I'm unable to locate the product I need to download.

The software downloads available to you depends on the subscription you're using. You can find downloads and product keys a few ways. 

## Excel list of available software 
You can [download an extensive list](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/5/4/15454442-CF17-47B9-A65D-DF84EF88511B/Visual_Studio_by_Subscription_Level.xlsx) of available software titles for all subscription types. To check what types are assigned to you, view your subscriptions in the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).   

## Find software downloads 
1. Sign into the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).  
1. Go to the [featured downloads page](https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads/featured).  
1. Here you will be able to see a list of popular downloads or search a specific product. Note: If you have more than one subscription associated with the same sign-in address, you will see the downloads included with the highest-level subscription, regardless of which subscription you're viewing.
1. Click on “get key” to see all keys that are available for the product you want to download. Then click “claim key” to claim a product key if the download requires a key to get started. 

## Find available product keys
You can also visit the [Product Keys](https://my.visualstudio.com/productkeys) page where all keys are available in aggregate. You can edit the notes column for identifying when and why you claimed the key.
