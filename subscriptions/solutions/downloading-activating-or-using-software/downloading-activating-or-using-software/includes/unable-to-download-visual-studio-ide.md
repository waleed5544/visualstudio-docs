## I'm unable to download or activate Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional

Your subscription level identifies which level of the Visual Studio IDE you have access to. For example, a Visual Studio Professional subscription does not have access to Visual Studio Enterprise. If you’re not sure which level you're using, see the subscriptions available to you by checking the [subscriptions page](https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions) in the portal.    

## How to download and activate 

1. Ensure you are signed in to the [subscriptions portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).
